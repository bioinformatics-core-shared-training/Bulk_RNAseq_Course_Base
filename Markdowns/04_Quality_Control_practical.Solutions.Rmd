## More detailed metrics with Picard Tools

### Duplication metrics

### Exercise 1

> 1. Run Picard's MarkDuplicates tool on the sorted bam file using the
>    following command:
> ```{bash eval=FALSE}
> java -jar picard/picard.jar MarkDuplicates \
>          INPUT=salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.sorted.bam \
>          OUTPUT=salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.mkdup.bam \
>          METRICS_FILE=salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.mkdup_metrics.txt \
>          CREATE_INDEX=true \
>          VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=SILENT
> ```
>> $\Rightarrow$ *salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.mkdup.bam*  - The new bam file with 
>> duplicated marked  
>> $\Rightarrow$ *salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.mkdup.bai* - The index for the new bam

>> $\Rightarrow$ *salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.mkdup_metrics.txt* - The duplication

> Q. What is the duplication rate for this bam file? You'll need to look at the
> metrics file. The easiest way is to open in a spreadsheet. On the course

> the bottom or side of the desktop, e.g.:

![](images/Launcher_bar_cacl.png){width=50%}

![](images/MarkDuplicates_results.png)

The duplication rate reported ~5%. 

Note that although the column headers for Picard say "PERCENT" or "PCT" the
number is in fact the decimal fraction and need to be multiplied by 100 for
percent. Just an odd quirk of Picard.

### RNA alignment metrics

#### Generate the refFlat file

```
./scripts/create_refflat_from_sam_header.py \
  -b salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.sorted.bam \
  -o references/GRCm38_transriptome_refFlat.txt
```
> $\Rightarrow$ references/GRCm38_transriptome_refFlat.txt

### Exercise 2

> 1. Run Picard's `CollectRnaSeqMetrics` tool on the sorted bam file providing
>    the following options:
>       * INPUT - The sorted bam file
>       * OUTPUT - *salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.RNA_metrics.txt*
>       * REF_FLAT - the RefFlat reference file
>       * STRAND - `NONE`
```{bash eval=FALSE}
java -jar picard/picard.jar CollectRnaSeqMetrics \
     INPUT=salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.sorted.bam \
     OUTPUT=salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.RNA_metrics.txt \
     REF_FLAT=references/GRCm38_transriptome_refFlat.txt \
     STRAND=NONE \
     VALIDATION_STRINGENCY=SILENT
```
>> $\Rightarrow$ *bam/SRR7657883.chr14.RNA_metrics.txt* - The RNAseq metrics  
>
> The results of this analysis are best viewed graphically, we will do this in
> the next exercise.

## 3. Visualising QC results with MultiQC

### Exercise 3

> 1. Run multiqc on the bam directory: 
> ```{bash eval=FALSE}
> multiqc \
>     -n Salmon_QC_Report.html \
>     -o salmon_qc_demo \
>     salmon_qc_demo
> ```   
>
> * `-n` - a name for the report
> * `-o` - the directory in which to place the report
> 2. Open the html report that was generated by multiqc and inspect the QC plots
>    The easiest way to do this is type 
> `xdg-open salmon_qc_demo/Salmon_QC_Report.html`, which will open the report in
> a web browser.


### Exercise 3.2

> In the `salmon` directory you should find Salmon outputs, duplication metrics
> and RNAseq metrics for all of the samples from the study.  
>
> 1. Run multiqc on the contents of the salmon directory.  
>
```{bash eval=FALSE}
multiqc -z -n Salmon_QC_Report.html -o salmon salmon
```
>> $\Rightarrow$ [salmon/Salmon_QC_Report.html](../additional_scripts/Alignment_QC_Report.html)   
>  
> 2. Open the html report that was generated by multiqc and inspect the QC plots   
>
> Q. Are there any bam files that look problematic?  

SRR7657893 has low alignment rate, an insert size profile that is skewed to 
left with a median at ~180 bp and a transcript coverage profile that shows
a strong 3' bias. This suggests that the RNA in the this sample has been 
degraded.
NOTE: This sample is not real - we have mocked up the metrics files for the 
purpose of illustrating a poor quality data set.
