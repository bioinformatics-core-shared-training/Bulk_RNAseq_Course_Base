```{r }
additive.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint + Status)
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                      colData = sampleinfo,
                                      design = additive.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]
ddsObj <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
results.additive <- results(ddsObj, alpha=0.05)
```

### The default contrast of `results`

The `results` function has returned the results for the contrast "Infected vs
Uninfected". Let's have a look at the model matrix to understand why `DESeq2`
has given us this particular contrast.

```{r viewModelMatrix}
model.matrix(additive.model, data = sampleinfo)
```

By default, `results` has returned the contrast encoded by the final column in
the model matrix. `DESeq2` has the command `resultsNames` that allows us to
view the contrasts that are available directly from the DESeq2 object.

```{r resultsNames}
resultsNames(ddsObj)
```

Let's just rename `results.additive` so that we know which contrast results it contains.

```{r}
results.InfectedvUninfected <- results.additive
rm(results.additive)
```

Let's get the top 100 genes by adjusted p-value

```{r topGenesPvV, message = F, results="hide"}
topGenesIvU <- as.data.frame(results.InfectedvUninfected) %>%
    rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
    top_n(100, wt=-padj)
topGenesIvU
```

```{r}
results.d33vd11 <- results(ddsObj, name= "TimePoint_d33_vs_d11", alpha=0.05)
```

```{r}
sum(results.d33vd11$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```


# Should we be using the interaction model?

So far we have modeled gene expression as a function of Status and Time Point 
with an additive model. 

Now we are going to look at interaction models and how to decide if we need one.

![](images/AdditiveAndInteractionModels.png)
[*pdf version*](images/AdditiveAndInteractionModels.pdf)

Let's plot a PCA from `vst` transformed data. 


```{r pcaPlot, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
vstcounts <- vst(ddsObj.raw, blind=TRUE)
plotPCA(vstcounts,  intgroup = c("Status", "TimePoint"))
```
Yes/no Do you think we need an interaction model?

In this case we can, from both the PCA and our understanding of the biology, be
fairly certain that the interaction model is the appropriate model to use. This
is not always the case and so we need a way to compare two models.

A warning: There are lots of things that you could put into the model, but each extra factor reduces power so you need the simplest appropriate model. How do we know what that is?

# SAVE SCRIPT

## Comparing two design models

Let's take a simple example to start with.

Suppose we thought that maybe `TimePoint` was irrelevant and really the only 
differences might be between `Infected` and `Uninfected` groups. We could fit 
the simpler model and this would give us more degrees of freedom and therefore 
more power, but how would we know if it was a better model of not? 

We can compare two models by using the "likelihood ratio test" (LRT). 

To do so we provide the LRT with a simpler model (one with less parameters) than
the one currently being used. 

Currently `ddsObj` is using the model `~TimePoint + Status`. Here we want to
compare to a model without the `TimePoint` parameter: `~Status`, this was our
`simple.model` from earlier.

```{r compareModels}
ddsObj.LRT <- DESeq(ddsObj, test = "LRT", reduced = simple.model)
results.Additive_v_Simple <- results(ddsObj.LRT)
results.Additive_v_Simple
```

header: what are we comparing?

The second line of the results output shows us the test we are doing:

  `LRT p-value: '~ TimePoint + Status' vs '~ Status'`

The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the two
models, i.e. the simpler model is sufficient to explain the variation in gene
expression between the samples. If thats true we might as well use the simpler model and get more power.

If the the adjusted p-value for a gene passes
a significance threshold (e.g. padj < 0.05) then we should consider using the 
more complex model for this gene. 

```{r nAdditiveSig}
sum(results.Additive_v_Simple$padj < 0.05, na.rm=TRUE)
```

We can see that for 66 genes the more complex model does fit the data better. 
Although we have a result for each gene, in practice we should choose one model
and apply it to all genes. 

Curiously then, this suggests that overall the simple model
is more appropriate than the additive model. Let's look into the interaction
model.

So what we actually want to test is interaction vs additive and that's down to you!

```{r interactionModel}
interaction.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint * Status)
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                      colData = sampleinfo,
                                      design = interaction.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]

ddsObj.interaction <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
```

## Extracting specific contrasts from an interactive model

If we are settled on using the interaction model, then we need to extract 
our contrasts with reference to this. That is, we can no longer ask the general
question "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected?", but must rather ask two quesions:

* "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected at 11 days post infection?"   
* "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected at 33 days post infection?"    

If we view the `resultsNames` for the interaction model, we can see the intercept
is Uninfected and 11 days post infection:

```{r resNamInteraction}
resultsNames(ddsObj.interaction)
```

The main effect `Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected` is therefore the difference
between Infected and Uninfected **at 11 days post infection**. 

```{r, resIntd11}
results.interaction.11 <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
                                  name="Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected",
                                  alpha=0.05)
```

To get the results for Infected versus Uninfected at 33 days post infection, 
we would need to add the interaction term `TimePointd33.StatusInfected`.

SHOW THEM
In the help page for `results` it shows us how to do this with a `contrast` in 
example 3.

```{r resIntd33}
results.interaction.33 <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
          contrast = list(c("Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected", "TimePointd33.StatusInfected")),
                                  alpha=0.05)
```

Number of genes with padj < 0.05 for Test v Control at day 11:

```{r nSigIntd11}
sum(results.interaction.11$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Number of genes with padj < 0.05 for Test v Control at day 33:

```{r nSigIntd33}
sum(results.interaction.33$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

We can see that there is a strong difference in the effects of infection on 
gene expression between days 11 and 33.

### Exercise 5
>
> Let's investigate the uninfected mice
>  
> 1. Extract the results for d33 v d11 for Uninfected mice. 
The the intercept is Uninfected mice at 11 days post infection, so the main 
effect `TimePoint_d33_vs_d11` is the result that we want.

```{r}
results.d33_v_d11_uninfected <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
                                        name="TimePoint_d33_vs_d11",
                                        alpha = 0.05)
```
> How many genes have an adjusted p-value less than 0.05?  

```{r}
table(results.d33_v_d11_uninfected$padj < 0.05)
```
> Is this remarkable?  
Maybe not. Do we really expect vast gene expression differences between the 
brains of mice that are slightly older than one another? It is possible that 
there could have been confounding factors, such as changes in enviromental 
conditions such as temperature or feeding regime, that may have effected gene
expression. In which case it was important to set the experiment up with 
control for both time points.
>
> 2. Extract the results for d33 v d11 for Infected mice. 
The the intercept is Uninfected mice at 11 days post infection, so the main 
effect `TimePoint_d33_vs_d11` is the result that we want.

```{r}
results.d33_v_d11_infected <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
      contrast = list(c("TimePoint_d33_vs_d11", "TimePointd33.StatusInfected")),
                                        alpha = 0.05)
```
> How many genes have an adjusted p-value less than 0.05?  

```{r}
table(results.d33_v_d11_infected$padj < 0.05)
```
>
> Do these results suggest another approach to analysing this data set?

Could we possibly treat the six uninfected samples as a single group with six
replicates and then just have 1 factor with 3 levels: Control, d11.Infected,
d33.Infected? This is really a biological question and not a statistical one.
