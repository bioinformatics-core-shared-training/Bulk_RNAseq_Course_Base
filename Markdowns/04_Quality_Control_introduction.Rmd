## QC of aligned reads

* Alignment Rate
* Duplication Rate
* Insert Size
* Transcript coverage

## QC of aligned reads - Alignment Rate

* Depends on:
    * Quality of Reference Genome
    * Quality of library prep and sequencing
    * For human and mouse > 95%

## QC of aligned reads - Duplication Rate

* Human exome is ~30 Mb therefore there are < 30 million possible reads
* Duplication rates in RNAseq can be > 40%

## QC of aligned reads - Insert Size

* Insert size is the length of the fragment of mRNA from which the reads are
derived

## QC Goals 
 
 * Ensure the experiment generated the expected data
 * Check is the sequencing depth and alignment rates are similar across samples 
 * Identify poor alignment parameters (sample quality, library prep ?)
 * Discover contamination from another organism or from DNA 
 * Identify biases present in the data
