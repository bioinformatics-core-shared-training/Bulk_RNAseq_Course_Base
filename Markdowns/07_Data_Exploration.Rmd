# Introduction

In this section we will begin the process of analyzing the RNAseq data in R. In
the next section we will use
[DESeq2](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html) for
differential analysis. A detailed analysis workflow, recommended by the authors
of DESeq2 can be found on [the Bionconductor
website](http://master.bioconductor.org/packages/release/workflows/vignettes/rnaseqGene/inst/doc/rnaseqGene.html).

Before embarking on the main analysis of the data, it is essential to do some
exploration of the raw data. We want to assess the patterns and 
characteristics of the data and compare these to what we expect from mRNAseq 
data and assess the data based on our knowledge of the experimental design. The
primary means of data explorations are summary statistics and visualisations.
In this session we will primarily concentrate on assessing if the patterns
in the raw data conform to what we know about the experimental design. This is
essential to identify problems such as batch effects, outlier samples and 
sample swaps.

Due to time constraints we are not able to cover all the ways we might do this,
so additional information on initial data exploration are available in the
[supplementary materials](Markdowns/S4_Additional_Data_Exploration.html).

In this session we will:

* import our counts into R  
* filter out unwanted genes  
* look at the effects of variance and how to mitigate this with data 
transformation
* do some initial exploration of the raw count data using principle component 
analysis  

# Set working directory

Before starting we need to make sure that the working directory for R is set to
the **RNAseq** directory, which contains all the necessary file for these
practicals. You can do this using the menu bar:

`Session` >> `Set Working Directory` >> `Choose Directory ...`

![](images/SetWorkingDirectory.png){width=75%}


or you can use the following code in the R console:

```
setwd("~/Course_Materials/RNAseq")
```

# Data import

First, let's load all the packages we will need to analyse the data.

```{r setup, message = FALSE}
library(tximport)
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## A brief description of the data set

The data for this tutorial comes from the paper [Transcriptomic Profiling of 
Mouse Brain During Acute and Chronic Infections by *Toxoplasma gondii*
Oocysts](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2020.570903/full) 
[@Hu2020]. The raw data (sequence reads) can be downloaded from the [NCBI Short 
Read Archive](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under project number 
**PRJNA483261**.

Please see extended material for instructions on [downloading raw files from
SRA](S1_Getting_raw_reads_from_SRA.html).

This study examines changes in the gene expression profile in mouse brain in 
response to infection with the protozoan *Toxoplasma gondii*. The authors
performed transcriptome analysis on samples from infected and uninfected mice at 
two time points, 11 days post infection and 33 days post infection. For each 
sample group there are 3 biological replicates. This effectively makes this a 
two factor study with two groups in each factor:

* Status: Infected/Uninfected
* Time Point: 11 dpi/33 dpi

## Reading in the sample metadata

The `SampleInfo.txt` file contains basic information about the samples that we will
need for the analysis today: name, cell type, status.

```{r loadSampleInfo, message = FALSE}
# Read the sample information into a data frame
sampleinfo <- read_tsv("data/samplesheet.tsv", col_types = c("cccc"))
sampleinfo %>% 
  arrange(Status, TimePoint, Replicate)
```

## Reading in the count data

Salmon [@Patro2017] was used to quantify gene expression from raw reads against
the Ensembl transcriptome GRCm38 version 102 (as described in 
[the previous session](05_Quantification_with_Salmon_practical.html)).

First we need to read the data into R from the `quant.sf` files under the 
*salmon* directory. To do this we use the `tximport` function. We need to create
a named vector in which the values are the paths to the `quant.sf` files and the
names are sample names that we want in the column headers - these should match
the sample names in our `sampleinfo` table.

The Salmon quantification results are per transcript, we'll want to summarise
to gene level. To this we need a table that relates transcript IDs to gene IDs.

```{r readSalmon}
files <- str_c("salmon/", sampleinfo$SampleName, "/quant.sf")
files <- set_names(files, sampleinfo$SampleName)

tx2gene <- read_tsv("references/tx2gene.tsv")

txi <- tximport(files, type = "salmon", tx2gene = tx2gene)
str(txi)
head(txi$counts)
```

Save the `txi` object for use in later sessions.

```{r saveData, eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(txi, file = "salmon_outputs/txi.rds")
```

```{r solutionExercise1}

```

### A quick intro to `dplyr`

One of the most complex aspects of learning to work with data in `R` is 
getting to grips with subsetting and manipulating data tables. The package 
`dplyr` [@Wickham2018] was developed to make this process more intuitive than it
is using standard base `R` processes. It also makes use of a new symbol `%>%`,
called the "pipe", which makes the code a bit tidier. 

In particular we will use the commands:

* `select` to select columns from a table
* `filter` to filter rows based on the contents of a column in the table
* `rename` to rename columns

We will encounter a few more `dplyr` commands during the course, we will explain
their use as we come to them.

If you are familiar with R but not `dplyr` or `tidyverse` then we have a very
brief introduction [here](../extended_html/02a_A_brief_intro_to_dplyr.html). A more detailed 
introduction can be found in our [online R course](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-intro/week4.html)

# Prepare count matrix

## Create a raw counts matrix for data exploration

DESeq2 will use the txi object directly but we will need a counts matrix to
do the data exploration.

```{r rawCounts}
rawCounts <- round(txi$counts, 0) 
```

## Filtering the genes

<!-- prefiltering -->

For many analysis methods it is advisable to filter out as many genes as 
possible before the analysis to decrease the impact of multiple testing
correction on false discovery rates. This is normally done
by filtering out genes with low numbers of reads and thus likely to be 
uninformative.

With `DESeq2` this is however not necessary as it applies `independent
filtering` during the analysis. On the other hand, some filtering for 
genes that are very lowly expressed does reduce the size of the data matrix, 
meaning that less memory is required and processing steps are carried out 
faster. Furthermore, for the purposes of visualization it is important to remove
the genes that are not expressed in order to avoid them dominating the patterns
that we observe.

We will keep all genes where the total number of reads across all samples is 
greater than 5.

```{r filterGenes}
# check dimension of count matrix
dim(rawCounts)
# for each gene, compute total count and compare to threshold
# keeping outcome in vector of 'logicals' (ie TRUE or FALSE, or NA)
keep <- rowSums(rawCounts) > 5
# summary of test outcome: number of genes in each class:
table(keep, useNA="always") 
# subset genes where test was TRUE
filtCounts <- rawCounts[keep,]
# check dimension of new count matrix
dim(filtCounts)
```

# Count distribution and Data transformations

Differential expression calculations with DESeq2 uses raw read counts as input,
but for visualization purposes we use transformed counts.

## Raw counts 

Why not raw counts? Two issues:

* Raw counts range is very large
* Variance increases with mean gene expression, this has impact on assessing
  the relationships.

```{r raw_summary}
summary(filtCounts)
```

```{r raw_boxplot}
# few outliers affect distribution visualization
boxplot(filtCounts, main='Raw counts', las=2)
```

```{r raw_mean_vs_sd}
# Raw counts mean expression Vs standard Deviation (SD)
plot(rowMeans(filtCounts), rowSds(filtCounts), 
     main='Raw counts: sd vs mean', 
     xlim=c(0,10000),
     ylim=c(0,5000))
```

## Data transformation

To avoid problems posed by raw counts, they can be [transformed](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#data-transformations-and-visualization).
Several transformation methods exist to limit the dependence of variance on mean gene expression:

* Simple log2 transformation
* VST : variance stabilizing transformation
* rlog : regularized log transformation

### log2 transformation

Because some genes are not expressed (detected) in some samples, their count are `0`. As log2(0) returns -Inf in R which triggers errors by some functions, we add 1 to every count value to create 'pseudocounts'. The lowest value then is 1, or 0 on the log2 scale (log2(1) = 0).

```{r logTransform}
# Get log2 counts
logcounts <- log2(filtCounts + 1)
# summary(logcounts[,1]) # summary for first column
# summary(logcounts) # summary for each column
```

We will check the distribution of read counts using a boxplot and add some
colour to see if there is any difference between sample groups.

```{r plotLogCounts}
# make a colour vector
statusCols <- str_replace_all(sampleinfo$Status, c(Infected="red", Uninfected="orange"))

# Check distributions of samples using boxplots
boxplot(logcounts,
        xlab="",
        ylab="Log2(Counts)",
        las=2,
        col=statusCols,
        main="Log2(Counts)")
# Let's add a blue horizontal line that corresponds to the median
abline(h=median(logcounts), col="blue")
```

From the boxplots we see that overall the density distributions of raw
log-counts are not identical but still not very different. If a sample is
really far above or below the blue horizontal line (overall median) we may need to investigate
that sample further.

```{r log2_mean_vs_sd}
# Log2 counts standard deviation (sd) vs mean expression
plot(rowMeans(logcounts), rowSds(logcounts), 
     main='Log2 Counts: sd vs mean')
```

In contrast to raw counts, with log2 transformed counts lowly expressed genes show higher variation.

### VST : variance stabilizing transformation

Variance stabilizing transformation (VST) aims at generating a matrix of values for which variance is constant across the range of mean values, especially for low mean.

The `vst` function computes the fitted dispersion-mean relation, derives the transformation to apply and accounts for library size.

```{r vst_counts, message=FALSE}
vst_counts <- vst(filtCounts)

# Check distributions of samples using boxplots
boxplot(vst_counts, 
        xlab="", 
        ylab="VST counts",
        las=2,
        col=statusCols)
# Let's add a blue horizontal line that corresponds to the median
abline(h=median(vst_counts), col="blue")
```

```{r vst_mean_vs_sd}
# VST counts standard deviation (sd) vs mean expression
plot(rowMeans(vst_counts), rowSds(vst_counts), 
     main='VST counts: sd vs mean')
```

### Exercise 2

> 1. Use the `DESeq2` function `rlog` to transform the count data. This function
> also normalises for library size.
> 2. Plot the count distribution boxplots with this data  
>    How has this affected the count distributions?

```{r solutionExercise2}

```


# Principal Component Analysis

A principal component analysis (PCA) is an example of an unsupervised analysis,
where we don't specify the grouping of the samples. If the experiment is well
controlled and has worked well, we should find that replicate samples cluster 
closely, whilst the greatest sources of variation in the data should be between
treatments/sample groups. It is also an incredibly useful tool for checking for 
outliers and batch effects.

To run the PCA we should first normalise our data for library size and transform
to a log scale. DESeq2 provides two separate commands to do this (`vst` and
`rlog`). Here we will use the command `rlog`. `rlog` performs a log2 scale
transformation in a way that compensates for differences between samples for
genes with low read count and also normalizes between samples for library size.

You can read more about `rlog`, its alternative `vst` and the comparison
between the two 
[here](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html#count-data-transformations).

To plot the PCA results we will use the `autoplot` function from the
`ggfortify` package [@Tang2016]. `ggfortify` is built on top of `ggplot2` and
is able to recognise common statistical objects such as PCA results or linear
model results and automatically generate summary plot of the results in an
appropriate manner.

```{r pcaPlot, message = FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
library(ggfortify)

rlogcounts <- rlog(filtCounts)

# run PCA
pcDat <- prcomp(t(rlogcounts))
# plot PCA
autoplot(pcDat)
```

We can use colour and shape to identify the Cell Type and the Status of each
sample.

```{r pcaPlotWiColor, message = FALSE, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
autoplot(pcDat,
         data = sampleinfo, 
         colour="Status", 
         shape="TimePoint",
         size=5)
```

### Exercise 3

```{r solutionChallenge1}

```

> ### Discussion: What do the PCA plots tell us about our samples?

<!-- amount and source of variation, sample swap, interaction -->

Let's identify these samples. The package `ggrepel` allows us to add text to 
the plot, but ensures that points that are close together don't have their
labels overlapping (they *repel* each other).

```{r badSamples, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
library(ggrepel)

# setting shape to FALSE causes the plot to default to using the labels instead of points
autoplot(pcDat,
         data = sampleinfo,  
         colour="Status", 
         shape="TimePoint",
         size=5) +
    geom_text_repel(aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, label=SampleName), box.padding = 0.8)
```

The mislabelled samples are *SRR7657882*, which is labelled as *Test* but should
be *Control*, and *SRR7657873*, which is labelled as *Control* but should be *Test*.
Let's fix the sample sheet.

We're going to use another `dplyr` command `mutate`. 

```{r correctSampleSheet}
sampleinfo <- mutate(sampleinfo, Status=case_when(
                                          SampleName=="SRR7657882" ~ "Uninfected",
                                          SampleName=="SRR7657873" ~ "Infected", 
                                          TRUE ~ Status))
```

...and export it so that we have the correct version for later use.

```{r, exportSampleSheet, eval=FALSE}
write_tsv(sampleinfo, "results/SampleInfo_Corrected.txt")
```

Let's look at the PCA now.

```{r correctedPCA, fig.width=6.5, fig.height=5, fig.align="center"}
autoplot(pcDat,
         data = sampleinfo, 
         colour="Status", 
         shape="TimePoint",
         size=5)
```

Replicate samples from the same group cluster together in the plot, while 
samples from different groups form separate clusters. This indicates that the
differences between groups are larger than those within groups.
The biological signal of interest is stronger than the noise (biological and 
technical) and can be detected. 

Also, there appears to be a strong difference between days 11 and 33 post 
infection for the test group, but the day 11 and day 33 samples for the controls
are mixed together.

Clustering in the PCA plot can be used to motivate changes to the design
matrix in light of potential batch effects. For example, imagine that the
first replicate of each group was prepared at a separate time from the second
replicate. If the PCA plot showed separation of samples by time, it might be
worthwhile including time in the downstream analysis to account for the
time-based effect.
