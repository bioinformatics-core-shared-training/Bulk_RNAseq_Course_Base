## Differential Gene Expression Analysis Workflow {#less_space_after_title}

## Transformation {#less_space_after_title}

For differential expression analyses we use raw counts but to visualise the data to explore it we use transformed data.

<div style="width: 45%;
            float: left;">

<div style="padding-top: 20px;
            padding-bottom: 20px;">
<img src="images/05s_rawCountsBoxPlot.png" class="centerimg" style="width: 95%">
</div>  
<div>
  
* The range of raw counts is very large
* Variance increases with mean gene expression
</div>
</div>

* Allows us to more clearly assess differences between sample groups

## Types of Transformations

* Log2 
* Rlog - Performs a log2 scale transformation in a way that compensates for differences between samples for genes with low read count and also normalizes between samples for library size.
* VST - Variance stabilizing transformation (VST) aims at generating a matrix of values for which variance is constant across the range of mean values, especially for low mean and accounts for library size.

## Principle Component Analysis {#less_space_after_title}

* Unsupervised analysis
* If the experiment is well controlled and has worked well, we should find that replicate samples cluster closely, whilst the greatest sources of variation in the data should be between treatments/sample groups
 * Useful tool for checking for outliers and batch effects
