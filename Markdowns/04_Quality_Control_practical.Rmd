# Checking the quality of the data

Once we have aligned our reads and quantified gene expression with Salmon, it is
then possible to run some additional quality checks on our data. We will use a 
tool call [Picard](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) to gather some 
information about duplication rates and the distribution of reads within each
gene in order to assess RNA integrity. We will also gather some QC metrics from
the Salmon outputs, such as alignment rate and insert size.

## Detailed metrics with Picard Tools

[**Picard Tools**](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) is a suite of
tools for analysing and manipulating sequencing data. It is maintained by the
Broad Institute and comprises many different tools for doing jobs such as
generating QC metrics, modifying bam files in various ways, or converting files
between different formats.

Picard is a java based programme and so to run a particular Picard tool the
general format for the command is:

```
java -jar picard/picard.jar PicardToolName OPTION1=value1 OPTION2=value2 ...
```

* `picard.jar` is the **J**ava **AR**chive file that contains all the tools. It
  can be found in the *picard* directory under *Course_Materials*. 
* `PicardToolName` is the name of the tools that you wish to use. 

This is then followed by a series of options/arguments for that particular
tool. Each tool has specific options and arguments and you can check these
most easily by going to the [Picard
website](https://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/), or by using the `--help`
command:

```
java -jar picard/picard.jar PicardToolName --help
```

# 1. Duplication metrics

The first tool we are going to use is `MarkDuplicates`. This tool
actually performs two tasks. 

First, Picard reads through the bam file and finds any duplicate reads - these
are reads with the same genomic location at the 5' end. For each group of
duplicate reads, Picard selects a "primary" read based on the base quality
scores and then marks all other reads in the group as "duplicates".  For paired
end reads, the entire fragment is considered, this essentially means both ends
must be duplicated for the read pair to be marked as a duplicate.

Once the duplicate reads are marked, Picard outputs a new bam file in which the 
duplicate reads are marked and then also generates a metrics file that contains
information about the duplication rate.

## Exercise 1

For the purposes of this exercise we will work with a bam file that only
contains 2 million reads. Running Picard on the full bam file would take too
long for the practical. You should find a file called
`SRR7657883.salmon.sorted.bam` under the directory `salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883`,
please use this file rather than the bam file you created in the previous
session.

# 2. RNA alignment metrics

The `CollectRnaSeqMetrics` tool produces metrics describing the distribution of
the reads across different genomic locations - intronic, exonic, intergenic,
UTR - and the distribution of bases within the transcripts. In our case the 
reads have been aligned to the transcriptome, so we can not determine the 
genomic location, however, the normalised coverage across transcripts is useful
information for assessing the integrity of the original RNA.

The `CollectRnaSeqMetrics` requires four pieces of information to run:

1. The input bam file  
2. A file name for the output metrics file
3. A file containing gene annotations in a format called **RefFlat**, which is
   defined
   [here](http://genome.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/gbdDescriptionsOld.html#RefFlat).
4. A parameter for strand specificity. Strand specificity is determined by the
   library prep chemistry. There are three possible options:  
        a) FIRST_READ_TRANSCRIPTION_STRAND - Forward stranded library prep, i.e. the reads are on the
           transcription strand   
        b) SECOND_READ_TRANSCRIPTION_STRAND - Reverse stranded library prep, i.e. the reads are on the reverse
           strand   
        c) NONE - Unstranded library prep, i.e. the reads may be on either strand    
    With your own data you would need to find this information out from whoever
    has prepared the library. In this case our library prep is unstranded, so we
    will use `NONE`.

## Generate the RefFlat file
  
The first thing we will need to do is construct the RefFlat file.  If we had
aligned our reads to the genome, each read in our bam file would have a genomic
location - a chromosome and a position on that chromosome. We would then need 
an annotation file that contained the genomic locations of the genes in the
genome in order to translate the genomic locations of the reads into gene based
information.

The RefFlat file is one of a variety of formats for describing gene annotation. 
In RefFlat format each line contains the information for a single transcript,
including contig/sequence (chromosome) on which the gene is located, the start
and end locations on the conig for the transcript, and the start and end
locations for each exon of the trancscript. The Picard tool
`CollectRnaSeqMetrics` normally uses this refFlat file to translate the genomic
alignments of reads into details of the gene encoded by the transcript molecule
from which the reads originated.

To analyse the alignments from Salmon, we still need to provide a refFlat file,
but in this case each contig/sequence in the reference is a transcript with a
single "exon" (the transcriptome fasta does not include introns). We can use the
sequence information that is stored in the header of the bam file to generate
this RefFlat file.

We can do this using the data contained in the bam file header. The file
`create_refflat_from_sam_header.py` in the **scripts** directory is a python
script that will read a Salmon mappings BAM file and generate the required
RefFlat file from the header.

For future reference, you can download the script from our [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/crukci-bioinformatics/BamHeaderToRefflat).In
addition to the python script, you will also need to have
[Python](https://github.com/crukci-bioinformatics/BamHeaderToRefflat) and
[samtools](http://www.htslib.org/) installed and on the
[PATH](https://opensource.com/article/17/6/set-path-linux).

`create_refflat_from_sam_header.py` requires two parameters:

* `-b` - the bam file to use
* `-o` - the output file name

```
./scripts/create_refflat_from_sam_header.py \
  -b salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.sorted.bam \
  -o references/GRCm38_transriptome_refFlat.txt
```

Note that we only have to do this once, we do not need to create a separate
refFlat file for each sample as they have all been quantified using the same
transcriptome reference.

## Exercise 2

> 1. Run Picard's `CollectRnaSeqMetrics` tool on the sorted bam file using the
>    following arguments:  
>       * INPUT - The bam file
>       * OUTPUT - `salmon_qc_demo/SRR7657883/SRR7657883.salmon.RNA_metrics.txt`
>       * REF_FLAT - the refFlat reference file
>       * STRAND - `NONE`
>       * VALIDATION_STRINGENCY - SILENT

# 3. Visualising QC results with MultiQC

[MultiQC](https://multiqc.info/) is a tool for collating multiple QC results
files into a single report. Its use is simple, you just run the command
`multiqc` on the directory containing your metrics files. The general command is:

```
multiqc <directory containing metrics files>
```

We will add a couple of options to control the output directory and the name
of the report.

## Exercise 3

> 1. Run multiqc on the salmon directory: 
> ```{bash eval=FALSE}
> multiqc \
>     -n Salmon_QC_Report.html \
>     -o salmon_qc_demo \
>     salmon_qc_demo
> ```   
>
> * `-n` - a name for the report
> * `-o` - the directory in which to place the report
>
> 2. Open the html report that was generated by multiqc and inspect the QC plots
>    The easiest way to do this is type 
>    `xdg-open salmon_qc_demo/Salmon_QC_Report.html`, which will open the report
>    in a web browser.

## Exercise 4

> In the `salmon` directory you should find Salmon outputs, duplication metrics
> and RNAseq metrics for all of the samples from the study.  
>
> 1. Run multiqc on the contents of the whole `salmon` directory.   
> 2. Open the html report that was generated by multiqc and inspect the QC plots 
>
> Q. Are there any samples that look problematic?
