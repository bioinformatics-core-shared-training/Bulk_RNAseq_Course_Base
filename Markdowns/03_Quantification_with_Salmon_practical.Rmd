# Quasi-mapping and gene expression quantification

So far we have QC'd our raw reads, and the next step is to quantify the gene
expression. One way would be to map the reads to the genome and use information
about where genes are located on the genome to count the number of reads coming
from each gene. This method is shown in the [extended materials using the
`featureCounts` tool](S8_Read_Counts_with_SubRead.html).

An alternative is to use faster methods known as *quasi-mapping* or
*pseudo-alignment*, followed by inferential estimation of gene expression. This
approach has been developed over the past few years and has the advantages of
being faster and more lightweight than full alignment (they can be run on a
laptop rather than needing a high performance cluster). In addition these
methods give more accurate estimates of gene expression at the transcript level
and incorporate corrections for GC-content bias and sequence bias. They are also
able to quantify multimapping reads in a more pragmatic manner than the standard
alignment/counting approaches giving more accurate counts, particularly for
genes belonging to families of genes with very similar sequences.

There are various tools that use this approach such at `Kallisto`, `Sailfish` 
and `Salmon`; we will use [`Salmon`](https://combine-lab.github.io/salmon/) 
[@Patro2017]. 

You can find the full manual here:

https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/salmon.html#using-salmon

This provides much more information about various options and the reasons for
using them. For most purposes we can simply use the default settings with just
a few extras.

# 1. Indexing the transcriptome for Salmon

Salmon encompasses both alignment and quantification in a single tool. Here we
will be aligning directly to the transcriptome rather than the genome. The transcriptome
reference is a FASTA file containing sequences for all transcripts. Before we
can run `Salmon` we need to create an index, which allows the Salmon to process the 
sequences more efficiently. For
common species is possible to [download](http://refgenomes.databio.org/)
pre-generated Salmon indexes, however, it is worth knowing how to create your
own. This process is more computationally intensive and will not run on
standard laptop or desktop.

The details of the index creation are taken from:

https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-tutorial/2019/selective-alignment/

As well as including the transcriptome, we also want to include the genomic
sequences. These will act as a *decoys* so that non-transcriptomic reads will not
be erroneously counted against transcripts.

The indexing takes too long with the full transcriptome for the purposes of this
training session, so we will work with the transcriptome for 
just genes on mouse Chromosome 14. 

The full transcriptome has been downloaded from Ensembl:

ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-102/fasta/mus_musculus/cdna/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa.gz

Note: This release is a few years old now, in reality you would want to use the
latest release. We will update the course materials in the future to use the 
latest release, but the overall process will be the same.

## Indexing the transcriptome

We are going to be giving Salmon both genomic and transcriptomic sequences to
index. These files will be in FASTA format. FASTA is a text-based format for
representing either nucleotide sequences or peptide sequences, in which
nucleotides or amino acids are represented using single-letter codes. Each
sequence has a header line that starts with ">". The header includes the name of
the sequence and possibly some information about the sequence. The sequence
itself is represented by one or more lines containing a string of nucleotides or
amino acids.

First we need to combine the transcriptome and genome files into a single FASTA
file.  It is important to have the transcriptome sequences first in the file.

The genomic sequences are included as *decoys*. The reason for including them is
that there may be reads in our library that did not originate from transcripts
in our references (either they are from transcripts that have not been annotated
or they are from genomic DNA). All aligners will always try to find an aligment
for a read if it is possible. If we only provided the transcript sequences,
some of these reads might adequately match the sequence of some transcripts and be
inappropriately aligned to these transcripts.  However, these reads will always
align better to their correct genomic sequences than to the transcript, and so
including the genomic sequences as decoys means that these reads will be aligned
to the genomic sequences instead.

In order that Salmon can distinguish between transcript sequences and the
*decoys*, we need a text file that lists the names of the decoy sequences. In
our case we are just using chromosome 14, so we just need to create a file
containing this.  Normally this file would contain the names of all the decoy
sequences.

Finally, we will need to provide salmon with the name of a directory in which to
create the index. We don't need to make the directory, salmon will do this
itself.

## Exercise 1 - Create Salmon index
> 1. Create combined trancriptome/genome FASTA file
> We can simply con*cat*enate the two files using the `cat` command.
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
>cat references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.chr14.fa.gz \
>    references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna_sm.chr14.fa.gz \
>    > references/gentrome.chr14.fa.gz
>```
>
> If you not familar with FASTA format, first take a look at the first couple of
> lines of the two input fasta files. First, the transcriptome:
>
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
>zcat references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.chr14.fa.gz | head -n 2
>```
![](images/03_header_of_transcript_fasta.png)
>
> and then the genome:
>
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
>zcat references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.dna_sm.chr14.fa.gz | head -n 2
>```
![](images/03_header_of_genome_fasta.png)
> 
> In each case the first line we see is the name of the sequence - in the first
> case it is the transcript name and in the second the chromosome name - and the
> second line is the (beginning of the) sequence itself. The decoy list needs to
> contain the names of the genomic sequences.
> 
> 2. Create decoy sequence list from the genomic fasta
>
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
>echo "14" > references/decoys.txt
>```
> 3. Use `salmon index` to create the index. You will need to provide three
>  pieces of information:
>     * the **Transcript fasta file** - *references/gentrome.chr14.fa.gz*
>     * the **decoys** - *references/decoys.txt*
>     * the **salmon index** - a directory to write the index to, use **references/salmon_index_chr14**  
>
> Also add `-p 7` to the command to instruct salmon to parallelize the process
over 7 cores, which is significantly faster than just doing the indexing in a
single process on 1 core.
> To find the flags for the other three pieces of information use:
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
>salmon index --help
>```
>
> One thing to note here is that we have not specified the `-k` parameter. This
> parameter sets the kmer size that the index will be based on and relates to
> the minimum size of kmer used for quasi-mapping. The default is 31 bases, and
> this is fine for read sizes over 75 bases. If your read size is less that 75,
> you would need to adjust this. You should set the kmer size to slightly less
> than half of the read length. Quasi-mapping looks for kmers that are perfect
> match to the reference sequence. If the kmer size is more than half the read
> length, then a read with a mismatch in the middle of the read will never be
> able to be mapped to the transcriptome, even if all other bases are a perfect
> match for the sequence at the location that it originated.

# 2. Gene expression quantification

Now that we have an index we can quickly get gene expression estimates directly
from our raw fastq files.

We can use the index for the full transcriptome/genome here, rather than just
chromosome 14, as this step is relatively quick. The full index should already
be in the references directory: `references/salmon_index`. For this exercise
we'll just quantify one sample: **SRR7657883**. We've already run salmon on the
complete data set. You can see the results in the `salmon` directory. We'll use
this for the differential gene expression analysis in later sessions.

We are going to be asking Salmon to output the read alignments as a SAM file as 
well as the gene expression quantification results. This is optional but we
would like this information for some QC. Unfortunately, this does cause Salmon
to take longer and running Salmon like this on the full fastq takes about 20
minutes. For the purposes of this practical we will use a smaller fastq file
with just 2 million reads - this way we can run Salmon in a reasonable time.
The files we will use are called *SRR7657883.subset_2M....*.


## Exercise 2 - Quantify with Salmon

> 1. There should already be a directory called `salmon_output` in the
>    `Course_materials` directory. If not, create it.
> 2. Use `salmon quant` to quantify the gene expression from the raw fastq.
> To see all the options run `salmon quant --help-reads`. There are lot of 
> possible parameters, we will need to provide the following:
>       * **salmon index** - *references/salmon_index*
>       * `-l A` - Salmon needs to use some information about the library 
>         preparation, we could explicitly give this, but it is easy enough
>         for Salmon to **A**utomatically infer this from the data.
>       * **File containing the #1 reads** - *fastq/SRR7657883.subset_2M.sra_1.fastq.gz*
>       * **File containing the #2 reads** - *fastq/SRR7657883.subset_2M.sra_2.fastq.gz*
>       * **Output quantification directory** - *salmon_output/SRR7657883*
>       * `--writeMappings=salmon_output/SRR7657883.salmon.sam` - Instructs 
>         Salmon to output the read alignments in SAM format to the file 
>         *salmon_output/SRR7657883.salmon.sam*.
>       * `--gcBias` - salmon can optionally correct for GC content bias, it is
>         recommended to always use this
>       * **The number of threads to use** - *7*

Salmon creates a separate output directory for each sample analysed. This 
directory contains a number of files; the file that contains the quantification
data is called `quant.sf`.

# 3. SAM to BAM with samtools

We can transform from SAM to BAM using `samtools`. `samtools` is a toolkit that
provides a number of useful tools for working with SAM/BAM files. The BAM file
format is a binary (not human readable) file and is considerably smaller than
the same data stored in SAM format. We will also sort the alignment entries
by location (Contig/Chromosome name and the location on the contig), this 
further improves the compression of the SAM to BAM. We will use the 
`samtools sort` function.

The general command is:

`samtools sort -O BAM -o my_sample.sorted.bam my_sample.sam`

Where the `-o` option is used to provide the output file name. There are many
other options, e.g. reads can be sorted by the read name instead of the position
or we can specify the number of parallel threads to be used -  to find out more
use `samtools sort --help`.

## Exercise 3

> 1. Sort and transform your aligned SAM file into a BAM file called
> `SRR7657883.salmon.sorted.bam`. Use the option `-@ 7` to use 7 cores, this
> vastly speeds up the compression.

> 2. Use, for example, `samtools view my_sample.sorted.bam` to check your BAM file

# 4 Make transcript to gene table

Salmon quantifies gene expression at the transcript level. When we come to do
our differential gene expression analysis in R, we will want to summarise this
to the gene level. To do this we need a table that links transcript IDs to gene
IDs. We have already created this for you, but, for reference, the code below
was used to generate this table from the sequence headers in the transcriptome
reference file.

**You do not need to run this code, we have already done this for you.**

```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo -e "TxID\tGeneID" > salmon_outputs/tx2gene.tsv
zcat references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa.gz |
  grep "^>" | 
  head |
  cut -f 1,4 -d ' ' | 
  sed -e 's/^>//' -e 's/gene://' -e 's/\.[0-9]*$//' |
  tr ' ' '\t' \ 
  >> salmon_outputs/tx2gene.tsv
```

1. `zcat references/Mus_musculus.GRCm38.cdna.all.fa.gz` - read the zipped fasta
1. `grep "^>"` - find the sequence headers, they all start with ‘>’
1. `cut -f 1,4 -d ' '` - extract the 1st and 4th entries on each line - transcript ID and gene ID
1. `sed -e 's/^>//' -e 's/gene://' -e 's/\.[0-9]*$//'` - remove the “>” from the beginning of the line, the “gene:” from the beginning of the gene ID, and the trailing “.x” number which indicates that version of the gene annotation
1. `tr ' ' '\t'` - replace spaces with tabs so that the table is tab delimited
