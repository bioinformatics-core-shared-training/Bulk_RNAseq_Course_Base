In our intial QC of the raw fastq file we will be interested in gathering
various metrics, such as the total number of reads, sequence length, or GC
content.  We will also want to summarise such things as base quality scores and
make assessments of the contamination of the reads with adapter sequence. 

[FastQC](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/) is a
quality control tool for high throughput sequence data that is maintained
by the Babraham Institute. It is free to download and use. It runs a number
QC analyses on sequencing data (in various formats, not just fastq) and 
summarises the results in a easy to read report.

The basic command to run FastQC is simply `fastqc`. 

Access the help page to find the basic usage an other options:

`fastqc --help`

The **Usage** is:

```
	fastqc seqfile1 seqfile2 .. seqfileN

    fastqc [-o output dir] [--(no)extract] [-f fastq|bam|sam]
           [-c contaminant file] seqfile1 .. seqfileN
```

The simplest way to use it is just to type `fastqc` followed by all the sequence 
files that you wish to QC. It will then run through as many files as you provide 
generating a report for each one.

There are many additional options that you can provide to modify the behaviour
of the programme. The most common one is `-o output_directory`. By default the
report is written to the same directory as the fastqc file, however, if you
would like to gather the QC in a different directory, you can specify this
using the `-o` flag followed by the name of the directory, e.g:

```
fastqc -o QC fastq/my_fastq_file.fastq.gz
```

In this case the above command will generate a report for the file
**my_fastq_file.fastq.gz**, which is in the folder **fastq**, and will have the
report written into a directory called **QC**.

Note that the output directory must already exist, FastQC will not create it.

### Exercise

> 1. 
>       a) Check the location of the current directory using the command `pwd`  
>       b) If the current directory is not
>       `Course_Materials`, then navigate to the
>       **Course_Materials** directory using the `cd` (**c**hange
>       **d**irectory) command:  
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
> cd ~/Course_Materials
>```
>
> 2.   
>       a) Use `ls` to list the contents of the directory. There should be directory
>    called **fastq**    
>       b) Use `ls` to list the contents of the **fastq** directory:  
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
> ls fastq
>```
>
> You should see two fastq files called *SRR7657883.sra_1.fastq.gz* and
> *SRR7657883.sra_1.fastq.gz*. These are the files for read 1 and read 2
> of one of the samples we will be working with (you can ignore the other fastq
> files for now).
>
>
> 3. Run fastqc on one of the fastq files:  
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
> fastqc fastq/SRR7657883.sra_1.fastq.gz  
>```
> This will write the QC report to the *fastq* directory.
>
> 4. Open the html report in a browser and see if you can answer these questions:  
>           A) What is the read length?  
>           B) Does the quality score vary through the read length?  
>           C) How is the data's quality?
