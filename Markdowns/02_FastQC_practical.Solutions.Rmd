### Exercise

> 1. 
>       a) Check the location of the current directory using the command `pwd`  
>       b) If the current directory is not
>       `Course_Materials`, then navigate to the
>       **Course_Materials** directory using the `cd` (**c**hange
>       **d**irectory) command:  
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
> cd ~/Course_Materials
>```
>
> 2.   
>       a) Use `ls` to list the contents of the directory. There should be directory
>    called **fastq**    
>       b) Use `ls` to list the contents of the **fastq** directory:  
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
> ls fastq
>```
>> SRR7657883.sra_1.fastq.gz  SRR7657883.sra_2.fastq.gz
>
> You should see two fastq files. These are the files for read 1 and read 2
> of one of the samples we will be working with.
>
>
> 3. Run fastqc on one of the fastq files:  
>```{bash eval=FALSE}
> fastqc fastq/SRR7657883.sra_1.fastq.gz  
>```
>> $\Rightarrow$ *SRR7657883.sra_1_fastqc.html*  
>> $\Rightarrow$ *SRR7657883.sra_1_fastqc.zip*
>
>  
> 4. Open the html report in a browser and see if you can answer these questions:  
>           A) What is the read length? **150**  
>           B) Does the quality score vary through the read length?  
>               Yes, the first few bases and the last few bases are typically
>               of lower quality.  
>           C) How is the data's quality?  
>               Overall, pretty good.
