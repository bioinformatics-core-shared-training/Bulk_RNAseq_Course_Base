Before starting this section, we will make sure we have all the relevant objects
from the Differential Expression analysis.

```{r loadData}
ddsObj.interaction <- readRDS("RObjects/DESeqDataSet.interaction.rds")
results.interaction.11 <- readRDS("RObjects/DESeqResults.interaction_d11.rds")
results.interaction.33 <- readRDS("RObjects/DESeqResults.interaction_d33.rds")
```

# Overview

- Getting annotation
- Visualizing DE results

# Adding annotation to the DESeq2 results

We have a list of significantly deferentially expressed genes, but the only
annotation we can see is the Ensembl Gene ID, which is not very informative. 

There are a number of ways to add annotation. One method is to do this using a 
Bioconductor annotation package. These packages which are re-built every 
periodically with the latest annotations. These packages are listed on the 
[annotation section](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___AnnotationData) 
of the Bioconductor, and are installed in the same way as regular Bioconductor 
packages. 

An another approach is to use `biomaRt`, an interface to the 
[BioMart](http://www.biomart.org/) resource. Using BioMart ensures that you are 
able to get the latest annotations for the GeneIDs, and can match the version of
the gene annotation that was used for read counting.

A third method is to use `AnnotationHub`, this is like the bioconductor
packages but in an online database like `bioMaRt`. They keep them slightly more
up to date than the standard bioconductor packages and each time you use them
the results are cached on your machine. 

Today we will use the `AnnotationHub` method. A workflow for annotation with
biomaRt is included in the extended materials section accessible on the course
website.

## Query the database

First we need to get the correct database from `AnnotationHub`. We make the
instance (the first time we do this it will create a local cache on your
machine so that repeat queries are very quick). 

As you can see `ah` contains huge amounts of information and it is constantly
changing. This is why it gives us the snapshot date so we know when our cached
version is from. The `ah` object actually online contains pointers to where all
the information is online and we don't want to download all of them as it would
take a very long time and we don't need all of it.

This object is a vector and you can get information about a single resource by
indexing with a single bracket `[` or download a resource with a double bracket
`[[`.

```{r, makeOrgDb, message=F}

# create an annotationhub instance
ah <- AnnotationHub()
ah

ah[1]

# Download the database we want to use
MouseEnsDb <- query(ah, c("EnsDb", "Mus musculus", "102"))[[1]]

```

This database contains the entire gene annotation from Ensembl release 102 for
mouse. It includes descriptions of genes, transcripts, exons, UTRs etc. 

We can turn the whole gene-level annotation table into a data frame so we can
work with it using the tidyverse suite of tools.

```{r queryOrgDb, message=F}
annotations <- genes(MouseEnsDb, return.type = "data.frame")

# lets see what information we have
colnames(annotations)

annot <- annotations %>%
  select(gene_id, gene_name, entrezid) %>%
  filter(gene_id %in% rownames(results.interaction.11))
```

**NOTE**: You may get an error with this command that looks like:

```{css, echo=FALSE}
.error {
   color: red;
}
```

```{r eval=FALSE, class.source="error"}
Error in (function (classes, fdef, mtable)  : 
  unable to find an inherited method for function 'select' for signature '"data.frame"'
```

This is due to the `select` function from **dplyr** (part of **tidyverse**)
being masked by the `select` function from one of the annotation packages. This
will have happened because the annotation package was loaded after the
**tidyverse**. You can either restart your R session and reload the required
packages, this time being sure to load **tidyverse** last, or just use
`dplyr::select` to explicitly use the `select` function from **dplyr**:

```{r maskingSolutino, eval = FALSE}
annot <- annotations %>%
  dplyr::select(gene_id, gene_name, entrezid) %>%
  dplyr::filter(gene_id %in% rownames(results.interaction.11))
```


### One-to-many relationships

Let's inspect the annotation.

```{r inspectAnnot}
head(annot)

length(annot$entrezid)
length(unique(annot$entrezid))
sum(is.na(annot$entrezid)) # Why are there NAs in the ENTREZID column?

```

Gene/transcript/protein IDs mapping between different databases not always
perfect. 
Although majority of IDs map between databases, small subset may not have
matching ID or may have more than one match. 
This is because feature identification algorithms, naming methodologies and
versions may differ among databases. For instance NCBI and HGNC give same ID
for different gene versions, whereas Ensembl assigned separate IDs for gene
versions. Read interesting discussion on
[biostars](https://www.biostars.org/p/119540/).

There are some Ensembl IDs with no EntrezID. These gene ids has no 
corresponding Entrez ID in the `EnsDb` database package. The 
Ensembl and Entrez databases don't match on a 1:1 level although they have 
started taking steps towards consolidating
[in recent years](https://m.ensembl.org/info/genome/genebuild/mane.html).

For example [Prkcg](https://www.genecards.org/cgi-bin/carddisp.pl?gene=PRKCG)
gene has two Entrez IDs but have one gene name and one EntrezID. 

The is another set of databases within `AnnotationHub` which you can call
instead called `OrgDb` which give you the 'latest' version and are more similar
to the bioconductor packages if you are more familiar with those. They contain
slightly more information than the `EnsDb` records.

## A curated annotation - one we prepared earlier

Dealing with all the one-to-many annotation mappings requires some manual 
curation of your annotation table. 

To save time we have created an annotation table in which we have modified the 
column names and dealt with the one-to-many/missing issues for Entrez IDs.

The code we used for doing this is available in the extended materials section.

```{r addAnnotation, message=FALSE}
ensemblAnnot <- readRDS("RObjects/Ensembl_annotations.rds")
colnames(ensemblAnnot)
annot.interaction.11 <- as.data.frame(results.interaction.11) %>% 
    rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
    left_join(ensemblAnnot, "GeneID") %>% 
    rename(logFC=log2FoldChange, FDR=padj)
```

**NOTE**: If you had the issue earlier with `select` being masked and you used 
the `dplyr::select` solution, you will also have an issue `rename` and will need
to use `dplyr::rename`.

Finally we can output the annotation DE results using `write_tsv`.

```{r outputDEtables, eval=F}
write_tsv(annot.interaction.11, "results/Interaction.11_Results_Annotated.txt")
```

# Visualisation

## P-value histogram

A quick and easy "sanity check" for our DE results is to generate a p-value 
histogram. What we should see is a high bar at `0 - 0.05` and then a roughly
uniform tail to the right of this. There is a nice explanation of other possible
patterns in the histogram and what to do when you see them in [this 
post](http://varianceexplained.org/statistics/interpreting-pvalue-histogram/).

```{r pvalHist, fig.align="center"}
hist(annot.interaction.11$pvalue)
```

## Shrinking the log2FoldChange

`DESeq2` provides a function called `lfcShrink` that shrinks log-Fold Change 
(LFC) estimates towards zero using and empirical Bayes procedure. The reason for
doing this is that there is high variance in the LFC estimates when counts are 
low and this results in lowly expressed genes appearing to show greater
differences between groups than highly expressed genes. The `lfcShrink` method
compensates for this and allows better visualisation and ranking of genes. We 
will use it for our visualisation of the data.

```{r shrinkLFC}
ddsShrink.11 <- lfcShrink(ddsObj.interaction, 
                       res = results.interaction.11,
                       type = "ashr")

shrinkTab.11 <- as.data.frame(ddsShrink.11) %>%
    rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
    left_join(ensemblAnnot, "GeneID") %>% 
    rename(logFC=log2FoldChange, FDR=padj)
```

## MA plots

MA plots are a common way to visualize the results of a differential analysis.
We met them briefly towards the end of [the DESeq2
session](10_DE_analysis_with_DESeq2.html). This plot shows the log-Fold Change
for each gene against its average expression across all samples in the two
conditions being contrasted. `DESeq2` has a handy function for plotting this.
Let's use it too compare the shrunk and un-shrunk fold changes.

```{r maPlotDESeq2, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=5}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plotMA(results.interaction.11, alpha=0.05)
plotMA(ddsShrink.11, alpha=0.05)
```

The DESeq2 in `plotMA` function is fine for a quick look, but these inbuilt
functions aren't easy to customise, make changes to the way it looks or add
things such as gene labels. For this we would recommend using the ggplot
package.

## Volcano Plots

Another common visualisation is the 
[*volcano plot*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volcano_plot_(statistics)) which
displays a measure of significance on the y-axis and fold-change on the x-axis.
We will use ggplot to create this.

### A Brief Introduction to `ggplot2`

The [`ggplot2`](http://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) package has emerged as an 
attractive alternative to the traditional plots provided by base R. A full 
overview of all capabilities of the package is available from the 
[cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf).

In brief:-

- `shrinkTab.11` is our data frame containing the variables we wish to plot
- `aes` creates a mapping between the variables in our data frame to the 
**_aes_**thetic properties of the plot:
    + the x-axis will be mapped to `logFC`
    + the y-axis will be mapped to the `-log10(pvalue)`
- `geom_point` specifies the particular type of plot we want (in this case a 
scatter plot)
- `geom_text` allows us to add labels to some or all of the points
    + see 
    [the cheatsheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf) 
    for other plot types

The real advantage of `ggplot2` is the ability to change the appearance of our 
plot by mapping other variables to aspects of the plot. For example, we could 
colour the points based on the sample group. To do this we can add metadata from
the `sampleinfo` table to the data. The colours are automatically chosen by
`ggplot2`, but we can specify particular values. For the volcano plot we will
colour according whether the gene has a pvalue below 0.05. We use a `-log10`
transformation for the y-axis; it's commonly used for p-values as it means that
more significant genes have a higher scale.


```{r volcano11Plot, fig.align="center", fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
volcanoTab.11 <- shrinkTab.11 %>% 
    mutate(`-log10(pvalue)` = -log10(pvalue))

ggplot(volcanoTab.11, aes(x = logFC, y=`-log10(pvalue)`)) + 
    geom_point(aes(colour=FDR < 0.05), size=1) +
    geom_text(data=~top_n(.x, 1, wt=-FDR), aes(label=Symbol))
```

## Exercise 1 - Volcano plot for 33 days

Now it's your turn! We just made the volcano plot for the 11 days contrast, you
will make the one for the 33 days contrast.

If you haven't already make sure you load in our data and annotation. You can
copy and paste the code below.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# First load data and annotations
results.interaction.33 <- readRDS("RObjects/DESeqResults.interaction_d33.rds")
ensemblAnnot <- readRDS("RObjects/Ensembl_annotations.rds")
```

> (a)
> Shrink the results for the 33 days contrast.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#Shrink our values
ddsShrink.33 <- lfcShrink(ddsObj.interaction, 
                       res = results.interaction.33,
                       type = "ashr")

shrinkTab.33 <- as.data.frame(ddsShrink.33) %>%
    rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
    left_join(ensemblAnnot, "GeneID") %>% 
    rename(logFC=log2FoldChange, FDR=padj)

```

> (b) 
> Create a new column of -log10(pvalue) values in your shrinkTab for 33 days.
>
> (c) 
> Create a plot with points coloured by FDR < 0.05 similar to how we did in 
> the first volcano plot

```{r echo=FALSE}
volcanoTab.33 <- shrinkTab.33 %>% 
    mutate(`-log10(pvalue)` = -log10(pvalue))

ggplot(volcanoTab.33, aes(x = logFC, y=`-log10(pvalue)`)) + 
    geom_point(aes(colour=FDR < 0.05), size=1)

```

> (d)
> Compare these two volcano plots, what differences can you see between the two contrasts?

## Venn Diagram

In the paper you may notice they have presented a Venn diagram of the results. 

![](../images/Venn.png)

We will recreate it with our analysis. To do this we are using the package
`ggvenn` which is an extension to `ggplot` from Linlin Yan.

```{r}
library(ggvenn)
```

First we have to prepare the data with a column for each set we want in the
Venn. The final table should look like this:

```{r echo=FALSE}
tibble(Geneid=rownames(results.interaction.11)) %>% 
  mutate(Upregulated_11 = results.interaction.11$padj < 0.05 & 
         !is.na(results.interaction.11$padj) & 
         results.interaction.11$log2FoldChange > 0) %>% 
  mutate(Downregulated_11 = results.interaction.11$padj < 0.05 & 
         !is.na(results.interaction.11$padj) & 
         results.interaction.11$log2FoldChange < 0) %>%
  mutate(Upregulated_33 = results.interaction.33$padj < 0.05 & 
         !is.na(results.interaction.33$padj) & 
         results.interaction.33$log2FoldChange > 0) %>%
  mutate(Downregulated_33 = results.interaction.33$padj < 0.05 & 
         !is.na(results.interaction.33$padj) & 
         results.interaction.33$log2FoldChange < 0) 
```

The first column contains the gene ids. The remaining columns are the four sets
that we want to plot on the venn diagram:

* Significantly up-regulated on day 11
* Significantly down-regulated on day 11
* Significantly up-regulated on day 33
* Significantly down-regulated on day 33

These columns contain logical vectors (TRUE/FALSE) that indicate when or not
the gene is included in that set.


```{r, fig.align="center", fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
vennDat <- tibble(Geneid=rownames(results.interaction.11)) %>% 

  mutate(Upregulated_11 = results.interaction.11$padj < 0.05 & 
                          !is.na(results.interaction.11$padj) & 
                          results.interaction.11$log2FoldChange > 0) %>% 

  mutate(Downregulated_11 = results.interaction.11$padj < 0.05 & 
                            !is.na(results.interaction.11$padj) & 
                            results.interaction.11$log2FoldChange < 0) %>%

  mutate(Upregulated_33 = results.interaction.33$padj < 0.05 & 
                          !is.na(results.interaction.33$padj) & 
                          results.interaction.33$log2FoldChange > 0) %>%

  mutate(Downregulated_33 = results.interaction.33$padj < 0.05 & 
                            !is.na(results.interaction.33$padj) & 
                            results.interaction.33$log2FoldChange < 0) 

ggvenn(vennDat, set_name_size = 4)
```

## Heatmap

We're going to use the package `ComplexHeatmap` [@Gu2016]. We'll also use
`circlize` to generate a colour scale [@Gu2014].

```{r complexHeatmap, message=F}
library(ComplexHeatmap)
library(circlize)
```

We can't plot the entire data set, let's just select the top 300 by FDR. We'll
want to use normalised expression values, so we'll use the `vst` function.

```{r selectGenes}
# get the top genes
sigGenes <- shrinkTab.11 %>% 
    top_n(300, wt=-FDR) %>% 
    pull("GeneID")

# filter the data for the top 300 by padj
plotDat <- vst(ddsObj.interaction)[sigGenes,] %>% 
  assay()
```

The range expression values for different genes can vary widely. Some genes will
have very high expression. Our heatmap is going to be coloured according to gene
expression. If we used a colour scale from 0 (no expression) to the maximum 
expression, the scale will be dominated by our most extreme genes and it will be
difficult to discern any difference between most of the genes.

To overcome this we will z-scale the counts. This scaling method results in 
values for each that show the number of standard deviations the gene expression
is from the mean for that gene across all the sample - the mean will be '0', '1'
means 1 standard deviation higher than the mean, '-1' means 1 standard deviation
lower than the mean.

```{r z-scale}
z.mat <- t(scale(t(plotDat), center=TRUE, scale=TRUE))
```

```{r colourScale}
# colour palette
myPalette <- c("royalblue3", "ivory", "orangered3")
myRamp <- colorRamp2(c(-2, 0, 2), myPalette)
```

```{r heatmap, fig.width=5, fig.height=8}
Heatmap(z.mat, name = "z-score",
        col = myRamp,
        show_row_names = FALSE)
```

we can also split the heat map into clusters and add some annotation.

```{r splitHeatmap, fig.width=5, fig.height=8}
ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(df = colData(ddsObj.interaction)[,c("Status", "TimePoint")])

Heatmap(z.mat, name = "z-score",
        col = myRamp,            
        show_row_name = FALSE,
        split=3,
        rect_gp = gpar(col = "lightgrey", lwd=0.3),
        top_annotation = ha1)
```

Whenever we teach this session several student always ask how to set the
colours of the bars at the top of the heatmap. This is shown below.

```{r ColouredsplitHeatmap, fig.width=5, fig.height=8}
ha1 = HeatmapAnnotation(df = colData(ddsObj.interaction)[,c("Status", "TimePoint")], 
                        col = list(Status = c("Uninfected" = "hotpink", 
                                              "Infected" = "purple"), 
                                   TimePoint = c("d11" = "lightblue", 
                                                 "d33" = "darkblue")))

Heatmap(z.mat, name = "z-score",
        col = myRamp,            
        show_row_name = FALSE,
        split=3,
        rect_gp = gpar(col = "lightgrey", lwd=0.3),
        top_annotation = ha1)
```



```{r saveEnvironment, eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(annot.interaction.11, file="results/Annotated_Results.d11.rds")
saveRDS(shrinkTab.11, file="results/Shrunk_Results.d11.rds")
saveRDS(annot.interaction.33, file="results/Annotated_Results.d33.rds")
saveRDS(shrinkTab.33, file="results/Shrunk_Results.d33.rds")
```
