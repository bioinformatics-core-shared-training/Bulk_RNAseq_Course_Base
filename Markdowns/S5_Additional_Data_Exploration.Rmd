# Introduction

In [session 05 - Initial exploration of RNA-seq 
data](05_Data_Exploration.html) we looked at how we could use 
principle component analysis to explore patterns in the samples related to the
variation in the gene expression, and how these could inform us about how well
our results conform to the experimental design.

The document shows some additional visualisations that should be run to further
explore our data.

# Load the data

First let's load the data and create the raw counts matrix as before. For the
visualizations we will add a new column called `SampleGroup` to the sample meta
data table that combines the Status and Time Point. This will allow us to
visualise the four sample groups.

```{r prepareData, message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)
library(patchwork)

# Read the sample information into R
sampleinfo <- read_tsv("data/samplesheet_corrected.tsv", col_types="cccc") %>% 
                   mutate(Status = fct_relevel(Status, "Uninfected")) %>% 
                   mutate(SampleGroup = str_c(Status, ".", TimePoint))
                   
# Read the data into R
txi <- readRDS("RObjects/txi.rds")

rawCounts <- round(txi$counts, 0)

# create colour vectors for plots
statusCols <- c(Infected="#FF7F00", Uninfected="#33A02C")
samgrpCols <- c(Infected.d11="#FDBF6F", Infected.d33="#FF7F00", 
                Uninfected.d11="#B2DF8A", Uninfected.d33="#33A02C")
```

# Samples

```{r}
sampleinfo
```

# Count density

In session 5 we looked at the distribution of the counts using a box plot. 
Another useful visualisation is to look at the density distribution of the 
counts.

Let's take a look at the count density for one sample using the `density` 
function from the base `stats` package.

```{r}
dens <- density(rawCounts[,1])
plot(dens, main = colnames(rawCounts)[1])
```

The data contains the very large range of counts (0 t0 >60,000), with most genes
having relatively low counts and a few with very high counts. As a consequence
this visualization is not very helpful. We need to transform the data so that we
can resolve the entire distribution. The most common way to do this is to log
transform the data. We will need to add a small value to the counts before log
transforming as we have zeros in the data set. The log of 0 is -Infinity.

```{r}
logCounts <- log2(rawCounts + 1)
dens <- density(logCounts[,1])
plot(dens, main = colnames(logCounts)[1])
abline(v=0)
```

This is better, but we can see that we have a very large peak at 0, which is 
dominating the distribution pattern. As in session 7 we will remove genes with
low read counts; these are likely unexpressed genes and the associated read
counts are likely to be noise.

```{r}
keep <- rowSums(rawCounts) > 5
logCounts <- log2(rawCounts[keep, ] + 1)
dens <- density(logCounts[,1])
plot(dens, main = colnames(logCounts)[1])
abline(v=0)
```

We still have some noise at the lower end of the count distribution, but we can 
now assess the read count distribution for expressed genes. We could be more
aggressive with the filtering, but this will suffice.

It would be more useful if we could plot all the samples together. We would
usually expect that the overall distribution of read counts should be similar
across all the samples. We could do this with the base R plotting functions, but
it is a rather cumbersome process, so instead we will use ggplot, as introduced
in [session 11](Markdowns/11_Annotation_and_Visualisation.html). 

`ggplot` requires the data to be in "tidy" format (also known as a "long
formatted data frame"), so we will need to transform our data matrix using the
`dplyr` function `pivot_longer`. `ggplot` has built in density plot, so won't
have to calculate the density first.

```{r}
logCounts %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    pivot_longer(names_to = "SampleName", values_to = "logCounts", everything()) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=logCounts, group = SampleName)) +
        geom_density(aes(colour = SampleName)) +
        labs(x = "log2(Counts)", title = "Raw count density")
```

We can add some information about the experiment by including the samplesheet
and colouring by "Status".

```{r, message=FALSE}
logCounts %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    pivot_longer(names_to = "SampleName", values_to = "logCounts", everything()) %>% 
    left_join(sampleinfo) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=logCounts, group = SampleName)) +
        geom_density(aes(colour = SampleGroup)) +
        scale_colour_manual(values = samgrpCols) +
        labs(x = "log2(Counts)", title = "Raw count density")
```

We can see that all the samples have roughly similar distribution profiles, but
that the infected samples show more variation in the distributions. We can
now have a look to see how normalisation would effect the count density.
We will use the `rlog` function from 
`DESeq2`.

```{r plotDat, message=FALSE}
rlogCnts <- rlog(rawCounts[keep, ])
rlogCnts %>% 
    as.data.frame() %>% 
    pivot_longer(names_to = "SampleName", values_to = "logCounts", everything()) %>% 
    left_join(sampleinfo) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x=logCounts, group = SampleName)) +
       geom_density(aes(colour = SampleGroup)) +
        scale_colour_manual(values = samgrpCols) +
        labs(x = "log2(Counts)", title = "Raw count density")
```

From this we can see that the `rlog` normalisation for overall library size has
brought the density distributions into similar ranges. We can see that it has
smoothed out the wide variations in the noise level counts at the left of the
plot. Furthermore, we can now observe that distribution of infected samples 
indicates that, relative to the uninfected samples, there are more genes in the 
2^10 range and less in the 2^5 range. This would indicate a general pattern of 
upregulation.

# Hierachical clustering

In session 7 we used principle component analysis to assess sources of variation
in the data set and the relationship between the samples. Another method for
looking at the relationship between the samples can be to run hierarchical 
clustering based on the Euclidean distance between the samples. Hierarchical
clustering can often provide a clearer view of the clustering of the different
sample groups than other methods such as PCA.

We will use the package `ggdendro` to plot the clustering results using the
function `ggdendrogram`.

```{r}
library(ggdendro)
hclDat <-  t(rlogcounts) %>%
   dist(method = "euclidean") %>%
   hclust()
ggdendrogram(hclDat, rotate=TRUE)
```

We really need to add some information about the sample groups. The simplest way
to do this would be to replace the `labels` in the `hclust` object. Conveniently
the labels are stored in the `hclust` object in the same order as the columns
in our counts matrix, and therefore the same as the order of the rows in our
sample meta data table. We can just substitute in columns from the metadata.

```{r}
hclDat2 <- hclDat
hclDat2$labels <- sampleinfo$Status
ggdendrogram(hclDat2, rotate=TRUE)
```

We can see from this that the infected and uninfected samples cluster separately.
For the infected samples, the replicates from the time points also cluster
separately, but for the uninfected samples there is no clear clustering by 
time point.

If we want to have more control over the look of the plot, we need to extract
the dendrogram plotting information and create the plot manually using ggplot.
We need to use two commands for this: `as.dendrogram` builds a dendrogram from
the hierachical clustering results, then `dendro.data` extracts the details for
plotting the dendrogram. The extracted object is a list with two tables:
`segment` contains the x and y coordinates for drawing the lines of the
dendrogram, `labels` contains the labels (sample names) and the x and y
coordinates for plotting them. We can add additional meta data to the `labels`
data frame.

In section below we've added a number of `theme` elements to the ggplot in order
to remove the axes, the bounding box and the background grid. Please see the
ggplot help pages for more information on themes.

```{r}
dendro.dat <-as.dendrogram(hclDat) %>% dendro_data()

dendro.dat$labels <- dendro.dat$labels %>%
    left_join(sampleinfo, by = c(label = "SampleName"))

ggplot(dendro.dat$segment) +
    geom_segment(aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend)) +
    geom_label(data = dendro.dat$labels,
              aes(x = x,
                  y = y,
                  label = label,
                  fill = SampleGroup),
                  hjust = 0,
                  nudge_y = 1) +
    scale_fill_manual(values = samgrpCols) +
    coord_flip() +
    labs(x = NULL, y = "Distance", title = NULL, fill = "Sample Group") +
    scale_y_reverse(expand = c(0.3, 0)) +
    theme(axis.title.y = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y = element_blank(),
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
          panel.background = element_blank())
```

# Correlation plot

Another useful way to assess the relationships between our samples is to look
at the pairwise correlations. 

We will use the package `corrplot` to visualise the pairwise correlations.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8, message=FALSE}
library(corrplot)
corDat <- cor(rlogCnts)
rownames(corDat) <- sampleinfo$SampleGroup
colnames(corDat) <- sampleinfo$SampleGroup
col <- colorRampPalette(c("#FFFFFF", "#77AADD", "#4477AA"))
corrplot(corDat, 
         method = "color", 
         addCoef.col = "black", 
         number.digits= 3,
         order = "hclust",
         is.corr = FALSE)
```

We can start to see the structure in our data set, but from the correlation
coefficients it would appear that all of the samples are very similar. Indeed,
this is true, most of the genes in the count matrix do not vary greatly in
expression across the samples and so the pairwise correlations using all genes
are very high.

To get a more useful impression of the data set it is best to restrict our
correlations to just the genes that are biologically informative, i.e. those
that have varying expression levels across our samples. As we intend to carry
out unsupervised clustering, we should not select genes based on differential
expression between the sample groups, but we can select genes based on variance
across all samples. We will select the top 1000 genes by variance.

```{r, fig.width=8, fig.height=8}
vars <- rowVars(rlogCnts)
ord <- order(-vars)
corDat <- cor(rlogCnts[ord[1:500],])
rownames(corDat) <- str_c(sampleinfo$SampleGroup, ".", sampleinfo$Replicate)
colnames(corDat) <- str_c(sampleinfo$SampleGroup, ".", sampleinfo$Replicate)
corrplot(corDat, 
         method = "color", 
         addCoef.col = "black", 
         number.digits= 3,
         order = "hclust",
         is.corr = FALSE)
```

We can see from this that for highly variable genes, the day 11 and day 33 
uninfected samples are more closely correlation to one another than the day 11 
and day 33 infected samples.

# Coda

It may not seem that we have learned much more about the data set from the
clustering and correlation plots than we did from the principle component
analysis, however, this is a very simple data set. In more complex situations
with more nuanced relationships between sample groups, these additional plots
can prove very informative.
