```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
additive.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint + Status)
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                      colData = sampleinfo,
                                      design = additive.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]
ddsObj <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
results.additive <- results(ddsObj, alpha=0.05)
```

### The default contrast of `results`

The `results` function has returned the results for the contrast "Infected vs
Uninfected". Let's have a look at the model matrix to understand why `DESeq2`
has given us this particular contrast.

```{r viewModelMatrix}
model.matrix(additive.model, data = sampleinfo)
```

By default, `results` has returned the contrast encoded by the final column in
the model matrix. `DESeq2` has the command `resultsNames` that allows us to
view the contrasts that are available directly from the DESeq2 object.

```{r resultsNames}
resultsNames(ddsObj)
```

Let's just rename `results.additive` so that we know which contrast results it contains.

```{r}
results.InfectedvUninfected <- results.additive
rm(results.additive)
```

Let's get the top 100 genes by adjusted p-value

```{r topGenesPvV, message = F, results="hide"}
topGenesIvU <- as.data.frame(results.InfectedvUninfected) %>%
    rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
    top_n(100, wt=-padj)
topGenesIvU
```

### Exercise 3

> If we want a different contrast we can just pass the `results` function the 
> **name** of the contrast, as given by `resultsNames(ddsObj)`.
> Look at the help page for the `results` command to see how to do this.
>
> 1. Retrieve the results for the contrast of d33 versus d11. 
> 2. How many differentially expressed genes are there at FDR < 0.05?

# Should we be using the interaction model?

So far we have modeled gene expression as a function of Status and Time Point 
with an additive model. Realistically, we expect the two factors interact such 
that differences in gene expression between infected and uninfected mice are not 
the same at different time point:

![](images/AdditiveAndInteractionModels.png)
[*pdf version*](images/AdditiveAndInteractionModels.pdf)

Let's plot a PCA from `vst` transformed data. 
Can you anticipate if the interaction term will be important?

```{r pcaPlot, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
vstcounts <- vst(ddsObj.raw, blind=TRUE)
plotPCA(vstcounts,  intgroup = c("Status", "TimePoint"))
```

In this case we can, from both the PCA and our understanding of the biology, be
fairly certain that the interaction model is the appropriate model to use. This
is not always the case and so we need a way to compare two models.

## Comparing two design models

Let's take a simple example to start with.

Suppose we thought that maybe `TimePoint` was irrelevant and really the only 
differences might be between `Infected` and `Uninfected` groups. We could fit 
the simpler model and this would give us more degrees of freedom and therefore 
more power, but how would we know if it was a better model of not? 

We can compare two models by using the "likelihood ratio test" (LRT). 

To do so we provide the LRT with a simpler model (one with less parameters) than
the one currently being used. 

Currently `ddsObj` is using the model `~TimePoint + Status`. Here we want to
compare to a model without the `TimePoint` parameter: `~Status`, this was our
`simple.model` from earlier.

```{r compareModels}
ddsObj.LRT <- DESeq(ddsObj, test = "LRT", reduced = simple.model)
results.Additive_v_Simple <- results(ddsObj.LRT)
results.Additive_v_Simple
```

The second line of the results output shows us the test we are doing:

  `LRT p-value: '~ TimePoint + Status' vs '~ Status'`

The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the two
models, i.e. the simpler model is sufficient to explain the variation in gene
expression between the samples. If the the adjusted p-value for a gene passes
a significance threshold (e.g. padj < 0.05) then we should consider using the 
more complex model for this gene. 

```{r nAdditiveSig}
sum(results.Additive_v_Simple$padj < 0.05, na.rm=TRUE)
```

We can see that for `r sum(results.Additive_v_Simple$padj < 0.05, na.rm=TRUE)`
genes the more complex model does fit the data better. Although we have a result
for each gene, in practice we should choose one model or the other and apply it
to all genes. Curiously then, this suggests that overall the simple model
is more appropriate than the additive model. Let's look into the interaction
model.

> 4. Extract a table of results using `results`.

```{r interactionModel, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
interaction.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint * Status)
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                      colData = sampleinfo,
                                      design = interaction.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]

ddsObj.interaction <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
```

## Extracting specific contrasts from an interactive model

If we are settled on using the interaction model, then we need to extract 
our contrasts with reference to this. That is, we can no longer ask the general
question "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected?", but must rather ask two quesions:

* "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected at 11 days post infection?"   
* "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected at 33 days post infection?"    

If we view the `resultsNames` for the interaction model, we can see the intercept
is Uninfected and 11 days post infection:

```{r resNamInteraction}
resultsNames(ddsObj.interaction)
```

The main effect `Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected` is therefore the difference
between Infected and Uninfected **at 11 days post infection**. 

```{r, resIntd11}
results.interaction.11 <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
                                  name="Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected",
                                  alpha=0.05)
```

To get the results for Infected versus Uninfected at 33 days post infection, 
we would need to add the interaction term `TimePointd33.StatusInfected`.

In the help page for `results` it shows us how to do this with a `contrast` in 
example 3.

```{r resIntd33}
results.interaction.33 <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
          contrast = list(c("Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected", "TimePointd33.StatusInfected")),
                                  alpha=0.05)
```

Number of genes with padj < 0.05 for Test v Control at day 11:

```{r nSigIntd11}
sum(results.interaction.11$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Number of genes with padj < 0.05 for Test v Control at day 33:

```{r nSigIntd33}
sum(results.interaction.33$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

We can see that there is a strong difference in the effects of infection on 
gene expression between days 11 and 33.

### Exercise 5
>
> Let's investigate the uninfected mice
>  
> 1. Extract the results for d33 v d11 for Uninfected mice.  
> How many genes have an adjusted p-value less than 0.05?  
> Is this remarkable?  
> 2. Extract the results for d33 v d11 for Infected mice.  
> How many genes have an adjusted p-value less than 0.05?  
>
> Do these results suggest another approach to analysing this data set?

## Save the results

Finally save the corrected sample metadata, the DESeq2 dataset, and the two 
DESeq2 results objects.

```{r saveObjects, eval=FALSE}
write_tsv(sampleinfo, "results/samplesheet_corrected.tsv")
saveRDS(ddsObj.interaction, "results/DESeqDataSet.interaction.rds")
saveRDS(results.interaction.11, "results/DESeqResults.interaction_d11.rds")
saveRDS(results.interaction.33, "results/DESeqResults.interaction_d33.rds")
```
