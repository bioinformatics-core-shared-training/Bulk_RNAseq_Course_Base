## Load the data

In the previous session we read the results from Salmon into R and created a 
`txi` object, which we then saved into an "rds" file. We can now load the txi
from that file to start the differential expression analysis. We will also need
the sample meta data sheet

First load the packages we need.

```{r message = FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)
```

Now load the data from the earlier session.

```{r loadData}
txi <- readRDS("RObjects/txi.rds")
sampleinfo <- read_tsv("data/samplesheet_corrected.tsv", col_types="cccc")
```

It is important to be sure that the order of the samples in rows in the sample 
meta data table matches the order of the columns in the data matrix - `DESeq2`
will **not** check this. If the order does not match you will not be running the
analyses that you think you are.

```{r checkSampleNames}
all(colnames(txi$counts)==sampleinfo$SampleName)
```

# The model formula and design matrices

Now that we are happy that the quality of the data looks good, we can proceed to
testing for differentially expressed genes. There are a number of packages to
analyse RNA-Seq data. Most people use
[DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html)
[@Love2014] or
[edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)
[@Robinson2010; @McCarthy2012]. There is also the option to use the
[limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) package
and transform the counts using its `voom` function .They are all equally valid
approaches [@Ritchie2015]. There is an informative and honest blog post
[here](https://mikelove.wordpress.com/2016/09/28/deseq2-or-edger/) by Mike Love,
one of the authors of DESeq2, about deciding which to use.

We will use **DESeq2** for the rest of this practical.

## Create a DESeqDataSet object with the raw data

### Creating the design model formula

First we need to create a design model formula for our analysis. `DESeq2` will 
use this to generate the model matrix, as we have seen in the linear models 
lecture. 

We have two variables in our experiment: "Status" and "Time Point". 

We will fit two models under two assumptions: no interaction and interaction of
these two factors, however, to demonstrate the how `DESeq2` is used we will start
with a simple model which considers Status but ignores Time Point.  

First, create a variable containing the model using standard R 'formula' syntax.

```{r modelForumla}
simple.model <- as.formula(~ Status)
```

What does this look like as a model matrix?

```{r modelMatrix}
model.matrix(simple.model, data = sampleinfo)
```

The intercept has been set automatically to the group in the factor that is
alphabetically first: `Infected`.

It would be nice if `Uninfected` were the base line/intercept. To get R to 
use `Uninfected` as the intercept we need to use a `factor`. Let's set factor 
levels on Status to use `Uninfected` as the intercept.

```{r setFactors}
sampleinfo <- mutate(sampleinfo, Status = fct_relevel(Status, "Uninfected"))
model.matrix(simple.model, data = sampleinfo)
```

# Build a DESeq2DataSet

We don't actually need to pass `DESeq2` the model matrix, instead we pass it the 
design formula and the `sampleinfo` it will build the matrix itself.

```{r makeDDSObj}
# create the DESeqDataSet object
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                       colData = sampleinfo,
                                       design = simple.model)
```

When we summarised the counts to gene level, `tximport` also calculated an 
average transcript length for each gene for each sample. For a given gene the
average transcript length may vary between samples if different samples are 
using alternative transcripts. `DESeq2` will incorporate this into its 
"normalisation".

# Filter out the unexpressed genes

Just as we did in session 7, we should filter out genes that uninformative.

```{r}
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]
```

# Differential expression analysis with DESeq2

## The `DESeq2` work flow

The main `DESeq2` work flow is carried out in 3 steps:

### `estimateSizeFactors`

First, Calculate the "median ratio" normalisation size factors for each sample 
and adjust for average transcript length on a per gene per sample basis.

```{r commonSizeFactors}
ddsObj <- estimateSizeFactors(ddsObj.filt)
```

#### Let's have a look at what that did

`DESeq2` has calculated a normalizsation factor for each gene for each sample.

```{r}
normalizationFactors(ddsObj.filt)
normalizationFactors(ddsObj)
```

We can use `plotMA` from `limma` to look at the of these normalisation factors
on data in an MA plot. Let's look at **SRR7657882**, the fifth column, which has
the largest normalisation factors.

```{r}
logcounts <- log2(counts(ddsObj, normalized=FALSE)  + 1)

limma::plotMA(logcounts, array = 5, ylim =c(-5, 5))
abline(h=0, col="red")
```

```{r}
logNormalizedCounts <- log2(counts(ddsObj, normalized=TRUE)  + 1)

limma::plotMA(logNormalizedCounts, array=5, ylim =c(-5, 5))
abline(h=0, col="red")
```

DESeq2 doesn't actually normalise the counts, it uses raw counts and includes
the normalisation factors in the modeling as an "offset". Please see the DESeq2
documentation if you'd like more details on exactly how they are incorporated 
into the algorithm. For practical purposes we can think of it as a normalisation.

### `estimateDispersions`

Next we need to estimate the dispersion parameters for each gene.

```{r genewiseDispersion}
ddsObj <- estimateDispersions(ddsObj)
```

We can plot all three sets of dispersion estimates. It is particularly important
to do this if you change any of the default parameters for this step.

```{r plotDisp}
plotDispEsts(ddsObj)
```


### `nbinomWaldTest`

Finally, apply Negative Binomial GLM fitting and calculate Wald statistics.

```{r applyGLM}
ddsObj <- nbinomWaldTest(ddsObj)
```

## The `DESeq` command

In practice the 3 steps above can be performed in a single step using the 
`DESeq` wrapper function. Performing the three steps separately is useful if you
wish to alter the default parameters of one or more steps, otherwise the `DESeq`
function is fine.

```{r theShortVersion}
ddsObj <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
```

## Generate a results table

We can generate a table of differential expression results from the DDS object
using the `results` function of DESeq2.

```{r resultsTable}
results.simple <- results(ddsObj, alpha=0.05)
results.simple
```


### Exercise 1

```

sum(is.na(results.simple$padj))
```

```

>
>

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
sum(results.simple$padj < 0.05 & results.simple$log2FoldChange < 0, na.rm = TRUE)
```

### Independent filtering

From `DESeq2` manual:
"The results function of the `DESeq2` package performs independent filtering by
default using the mean of normalized counts as a filter statistic. A threshold 
on the filter statistic is found which optimizes the number of adjusted p values
lower than a [specified] significance level".

The default significance level for independent filtering is `0.1`, however, you
should set this to the FDR cut off you are planning to use. We will use `0.05` -
this was the purpose of the `alpha` argument in the previous command.

Remember 
in Session 7 we said that there is no need to pre-filter the genes as DESeq2
will do this through a process it calls 'independent filtering'. The genes 
with `NA` are the ones `DESeq2` has filtered out.

```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
additive.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint + Status)
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                      colData = sampleinfo,
                                      design = additive.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]
ddsObj <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
results.additive <- results(ddsObj, alpha=0.05)
```

### The default contrast of `results`

The `results` function has returned the results for the contrast "Infected vs
Uninfected". Let's have a look at the model matrix to understand why `DESeq2`
has given us this particular contrast.

```{r viewModelMatrix}
model.matrix(additive.model, data = sampleinfo)
```

By default, `results` has returned the contrast encoded by the final column in
the model matrix. `DESeq2` has the command `resultsNames` that allows us to
view the contrasts that are available directly from the DESeq2 object.

```{r resultsNames}
resultsNames(ddsObj)
```

Let's just rename `results.additive` so that we know which contrast results it contains.

```{r}
results.InfectedvUninfected <- results.additive
rm(results.additive)
```

Let's get the top 100 genes by adjusted p-value

```{r topGenesPvV, message = F, results="hide"}
topGenesIvU <- as.data.frame(results.InfectedvUninfected) %>%
    rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
    top_n(100, wt=-padj)
topGenesIvU
```

> 2. How many differentially expressed genes are there at FDR < 0.05?

# Should we be using the interaction model?

So far we have modeled gene expression as a function of Status and Time Point 
with an additive model. Realistically, we expect the two factors interact such 
that differences in gene expression between infected and uninfected mice are not 
the same at different time point:
![](images/AdditiveAndInteractionModels.png)
[*pdf version*](images/AdditiveAndInteractionModels.pdf)

Let's plot a PCA from `vst` transformed data. 
Can you anticipate if the interaction term will be important?

```{r pcaPlot, fig.width=5, fig.height=5}
vstcounts <- vst(ddsObj.raw, blind=TRUE)
plotPCA(vstcounts,  intgroup = c("Status", "TimePoint"))
```

In this case we can, from both the PCA and our understanding of the biology, be
fairly certain that the interaction model is the appropriate model to use. This
is not always the case and so we need a way to compare two models.

## Comparing two design models

Let's take a simple example to start with.

Suppose we thought that maybe `TimePoint` was irrelevant and really the only 
differences might be between `Infected` and `Uninfected` groups. We could fit 
the simpler model and this would give us more degrees of freedom and therefore 
more power, but how would we know if it was a better model of not? 

We can compare two models by using the "likelihood ratio test" (LRT). 

To do so we provide the LRT with a simpler model (one with less parameters) than
the one currently being used. 

Currently `ddsObj` is using the model `~TimePoint + Status`. Here we want to
compare to a model without the `TimePoint` parameter: `~Status`, this was our
`simple.model` from earlier.

```{r compareModels}
ddsObj.LRT <- DESeq(ddsObj, test = "LRT", reduced = simple.model)
results.Additive_v_Simple <- results(ddsObj.LRT)
results.Additive_v_Simple
```

The second line of the results output shows us the test we are doing:

  `LRT p-value: '~ TimePoint + Status' vs '~ Status'`

The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference between the two
models, i.e. the simpler model is sufficient to explain the variation in gene
expression between the samples. If the the adjusted p-value for a gene passes
a significance threshold (e.g. padj < 0.05) then we should consider using the 
more complex model for this gene. 

```{r nAdditiveSig}
sum(results.Additive_v_Simple$padj < 0.05, na.rm=TRUE)
```

We can see that for `r sum(results.Additive_v_Simple$padj < 0.05, na.rm=TRUE)`
genes the more complex model does fit the data better. Although we have a result
for each gene, in practice we should choose one model or the other and apply it
to all genes. Curiously then, this suggests that overall the simple model
is more appropriate than the additive model. Let's look into the interaction
model.

```{r interactionModel, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, include=FALSE}
interaction.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint * Status)
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                      colData = sampleinfo,
                                      design = interaction.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]

ddsObj.interaction <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
```

## Extracting specific contrasts from an interactive model

If we are settled on using the interaction model, then we need to extract 
our contrasts with reference to this. That is, we can no longer ask the general
question "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected?", but must rather ask two quesions:

* "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected at 11 days post infection?"   
* "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected at 33 days post infection?"    

If we view the `resultsNames` for the interaction model, we can see the intercept
is Uninfected and 11 days post infection:

```{r resNamInteraction}
resultsNames(ddsObj.interaction)
```

The main effect `Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected` is therefore the difference
between Infected and Uninfected **at 11 days post infection**. 

```{r, resIntd11}
results.interaction.11 <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
                                  name="Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected",
                                  alpha=0.05)
```

To get the results for Infected versus Uninfected at 33 days post infection, 
we would need to add the interaction term `TimePointd33.StatusInfected`.

In the help page for `results` it shows us how to do this with a `contrast` in 
example 3.

```{r resIntd33}
results.interaction.33 <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
          contrast = list(c("Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected", "TimePointd33.StatusInfected")),
                                  alpha=0.05)
```

Number of genes with padj < 0.05 for Test v Control at day 11:

```{r nSigIntd11}
sum(results.interaction.11$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Number of genes with padj < 0.05 for Test v Control at day 33:

```{r nSigIntd33}
sum(results.interaction.33$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

We can see that there is a strong difference in the effects of infection on 
gene expression between days 11 and 33.

### Exercise 5

>  
> 1. Extract the results for d33 v d11 for Uninfected mice.

> 2. Extract the results for d33 v d11 for Infected mice.  
> How many genes have an adjusted p-value less than 0.05?  
>
> Do these results suggest another approach to analysing this data set?

## Save the results

Finally save the corrected sample metadata, the DESeq2 dataset, and the two 
DESeq2 results objects.

```{r saveObjects, eval=FALSE}
write_tsv(sampleinfo, "results/samplesheet_corrected.tsv")
saveRDS(ddsObj.interaction, "results/DESeqDataSet.interaction.rds")
saveRDS(results.interaction.11, "results/DESeqResults.interaction_d11.rds")
saveRDS(results.interaction.33, "results/DESeqResults.interaction_d33.rds")
```
