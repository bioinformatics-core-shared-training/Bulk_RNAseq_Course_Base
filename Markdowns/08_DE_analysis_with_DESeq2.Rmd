# 1. R packages for differential gene expression analysis

Now that we are happy that the quality of the data looks good, we can proceed to
testing for differentially expressed genes. There are a number of packages to
analyse RNA-Seq data. Most people use
[DESeq2](http://bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/DESeq2/inst/doc/DESeq2.html)
[@Love2014] or
[edgeR](http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/edgeR.html)
[@Robinson2010; @McCarthy2012]. There is also the option to use the
[limma](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) package
and transform the counts using its `voom` function .They are all equally valid
approaches [@Ritchie2015]. There is an informative and honest blog post
[here](https://mikelove.wordpress.com/2016/09/28/deseq2-or-edger/) by Mike Love,
one of the authors of DESeq2, about deciding which to use.

We will use **DESeq2** for the rest of this practical.

To start with we will need three pieces of information to pass to DESeq2:

* The raw counts data
* The sample meta data
* The design model

# 2. Load the counts data and sample meta data

In the previous session we read the results from Salmon into R and created a 
`txi` object, which we then saved into an "rds" file. We can now load the txi
from that file to start the differential expression analysis. We will also need
the sample meta data sheet

First load the packages we need.

```{r message=FALSE}
library(DESeq2)
library(tidyverse)
```

Now load the data from the earlier session.

```{r loadData}
txi <- readRDS("RObjects/txi.rds")
sampleinfo <- read_tsv("data/samplesheet_corrected.tsv", col_types = "cccc")
```

It is important to be sure that the order of the samples in rows in the sample 
meta data table matches the order of the columns in the data matrix - `DESeq2`
will **not** check this. If the order does not match you will not be running the
analyses that you think you are.

```{r checkSampleNames}
all(colnames(txi$counts) == sampleinfo$SampleName)
```

# 3. Creating the design model formula

Next we need to create a design model formula for our analysis. `DESeq2` will 
use this to generate the model matrix, as we have seen in the linear models 
lecture. 

We have two variables in our experiment: "Status" and "Time Point". 

We will fit two models under two assumptions: no interaction and interaction of
these two factors, however, to demonstrate the how `DESeq2` is used we will start
with a simple model which considers just one factor.  

## The simple model

First, create a variable containing the model using standard R 'formula' syntax.

```{r modelForumla}
simple.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint)
```

What does this look like as a model matrix?

```{r modelMatrix}
model.matrix(simple.model, data = sampleinfo)
```

The model matrix haStatuss two columns.
We can see that our variable "TimePoint" has been turned into two indicator
variables called `(Intercept)` and `TimePointd33`. These match what we talked about
earlier:

* `(Intercept)` is the indicator variable for $\beta0$. This is our reference group,
  which in this case is day 11.
* `TimePointd33` is the indicator variable for $\beta1$, and tells us whether samples
  belong to the day 33 group.

Thus, our $\beta1$ coefficient is the difference in gene expression between day 33
and day 11.

## Exercise 1

> This time create and investigate the model matrix for the variable "Status".
>
> 1. Create a model formula to investigate the effect of “Status” on gene expression.    
> 2. Look at the model matrix and identify which is the reference group in your model.     

The intercept has been set automatically to the group in the factor that is
alphabetically first: `Infected`.

It would be nice if `Uninfected` were the base line/intercept. To get R to 
use `Uninfected` as the intercept we need to use a `factor`. Let's set factor 
levels on Status to use `Uninfected` as the intercept.

```{r setFactors}
sampleinfo <- mutate(sampleinfo, Status = fct_relevel(Status, "Uninfected"))
model.matrix(simple.model, data = sampleinfo)
```

# 4. Build a DESeq2DataSet

We don't actually need to pass `DESeq2` the model matrix, instead we pass it the 
design formula and the `sampleinfo` it will build the matrix itself. We will continue
to use the simple model for `Status` that we just created. If you haven't
already done that, do so now:

```{r statusSimpleModel}
simple.model <- as.formula(~ Status)
sampleinfo <- mutate(sampleinfo, Status = fct_relevel(Status, "Uninfected"))
```

We can now build our DESeq2 object using the three necessary components:

* The `txi` object containing the counts
* The `sampleinfo` data frame containing the sample metadata
* The `simple.model` design formula

```{r makeDDSObj}
# create the DESeqDataSet object
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                       colData = sampleinfo,
                                       design = simple.model)
```

When we summarised the counts to gene level, `tximport` also calculated an 
average transcript length for each gene for each sample. For a given gene the
average transcript length may vary between samples if different samples are 
using alternative transcripts. `DESeq2` will incorporate this into its 
"normalisation".

## Filter out the unexpressed genes

Just as we did in session 7, we should filter out genes that uninformative.

```{r}
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]
```

# 5. Differential expression analysis with DESeq2

## The `DESeq2` work flow

The main `DESeq2` work flow is carried out in 3 steps:

### `estimateSizeFactors`

First, Calculate the "median ratio" normalisation size factors for each sample 
and adjust for average transcript length on a per gene per sample basis.

```{r commonSizeFactors}
ddsObj <- estimateSizeFactors(ddsObj.filt)
```

#### Let's have a look at what that did

`DESeq2` has calculated a normalizsation factor for each gene for each sample.

```{r}
normalizationFactors(ddsObj.filt)
normalizationFactors(ddsObj)
```

We can use `plotMA` from `limma` to look at the of these normalisation factors
on data in an MA plot. Let's look at **SRR7657882**, the fifth column, which has
the largest normalisation factors.

```{r}
logcounts <- log2(counts(ddsObj, normalized = FALSE)  + 1)

limma::plotMA(logcounts, array = 5, ylim =c(-5, 5))
abline(h = 0, col = "red")
```

```{r}
logNormalizedCounts <- log2(counts(ddsObj, normalized = TRUE)  + 1)

limma::plotMA(logNormalizedCounts, array = 5, ylim =c(-5, 5))
abline(h = 0, col = "red")
```

DESeq2 doesn't actually normalise the counts, it uses raw counts and includes
the normalisation factors in the modeling as an "offset". Please see the DESeq2
documentation if you'd like more details on exactly how they are incorporated 
into the algorithm. For practical purposes we can think of it as a normalisation.

### `estimateDispersions`

Next we need to estimate the dispersion parameters for each gene.

```{r genewiseDispersion}
ddsObj <- estimateDispersions(ddsObj)
```

We can plot all three sets of dispersion estimates. It is particularly important
to do this if you change any of the default parameters for this step.

```{r plotDisp}
plotDispEsts(ddsObj)
```

### `nbinomWaldTest`

Finally, apply Negative Binomial GLM fitting and calculate Wald statistics.

```{r applyGLM}
ddsObj <- nbinomWaldTest(ddsObj)
```

## The `DESeq` command

In practice the 3 steps above can be performed in a single step using the 
`DESeq` wrapper function. Performing the three steps separately is useful if you
wish to alter the default parameters of one or more steps, otherwise the `DESeq`
function is fine.

```{r theShortVersion}
ddsObj <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
```

# 6. Generate a table of differential expression results

We can generate a table of differential expression results from the DDS object
using the `results` function of DESeq2.

```{r resultsTable}
results.simple <- results(ddsObj, alpha = 0.05)
results.simple
```

## Exercise 2

> How can you explain this apparent contradiction?

## Independent filtering

From `DESeq2` manual:
"The results function of the `DESeq2` package performs independent filtering by
default using the mean of normalized counts as a filter statistic. A threshold 
on the filter statistic is found which optimizes the number of adjusted p values
lower than a [specified] significance level".

The default significance level for independent filtering is `0.1`, however, you
should set this to the FDR cut off you are planning to use. We will use `0.05` -
this was the purpose of the `alpha` argument in the previous command.

Remember 
in Session 7 we said that there is no need to pre-filter the genes as DESeq2
will do this through a process it calls 'independent filtering'. The genes 
with `NA` are the ones `DESeq2` has filtered out.

# 7. The additive model

So far we have fitted a simple model considering just "Status", but in reality 
we want to model the effects of both "Status" and "Time Point".

Let's start with the model with only main effects - an additive model with no 
interaction. The main assumption here is that the effects of Status and the
effects of Time Point are indepedent.

First we create the additive model as a forumla object.
 
```{r eval = FALSE}
additive.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint + Status)
```
 
As before, we can now build the DESeq from the raw data, the sample meta data
and the model, and then filter the data set.
 
```{r eval = FALSE}
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                       colData = sampleinfo,
                                       design = additive.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep, ]
```


## Exercise 3

> You are now ready to run the differential gene expression analysis
> Run the DESeq2 analysis
> 
> 1. Run the size factor estimation, dispersion estimation and modelling steps 
> using the `DESeq` command as above.
> 
> 2. Extract the default contrast using the `results` command into a new object 
> called `results.additive`
>
> Questions:
>
>     a) How many coefficients are there in the additive model?   
>     b) What is the reference group in the additive model?    
>     c) What contrasts could we perform using this model?    
>     d) What contrast does the `results.additive` object represent?   
>     e) How many genes have an adjusted p-value of less than 0.05  
 
```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
additive.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint + Status)
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                      colData = sampleinfo,
                                      design = additive.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]
ddsObj <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
results.additive <- results(ddsObj, alpha = 0.05)
```

### The default contrast of `results` function

The `results` function has returned the results for the contrast "Infected vs
Uninfected". Let's have a look at the model matrix to understand why `DESeq2`
has given us this particular contrast.

```{r viewModelMatrix}
model.matrix(additive.model, data = sampleinfo)
```

By default, `results` has returned the contrast encoded by the final column in
the model matrix. `DESeq2` has the command `resultsNames` that allows us to
view the contrasts that are available directly from the coefficients of the
model.

```{r resultsNames}
resultsNames(ddsObj)
```

## Exercise 4

> How do the named coefficients above relate to $\beta_i$ coefficients in the
> design formula:
>
> $$
> expression = \beta_0 + \beta_1 TimePoint_{d33} + \beta_2 Status_{Infected}
> $$

Let's just rename `results.additive` so that we know which contrast results it contains.

```{r}
results.InfectedvUninfected <- results.additive
rm(results.additive)
```

Let's get the top 100 genes by adjusted p-value

```{r topGenesPvV, message = F, results = "hide"}
topGenesIvU <- as.data.frame(results.InfectedvUninfected) %>%
    rownames_to_column("GeneID") %>% 
    top_n(100, wt = -padj)
topGenesIvU
```

## Exercise 5

> If we want a different contrast we can just pass the `results` function the 
> **name** of the contrast, as given by `resultsNames(ddsObj)`.
> Look at the help page for the `results` command to see how to do this.
>
> 1. Retrieve the results for the contrast of d33 versus d11. 
> 2. How many differentially expressed genes are there at FDR < 0.05?

# 8. The interaction model 

So far we have modeled gene expression as a function of Status and Time Point 
with an additive model. Realistically, we would probably expect the two factors
interact such that differences in gene expression between infected and
uninfected mice are not the same at different time points.

![](images/AdditiveAndInteractionModels.png)
[*pdf version*](images/AdditiveAndInteractionModels.pdf)

Let's plot a PCA from `vst` transformed data. 
Can you anticipate if the interaction term will be important?

```{r pcaPlot, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
vstcounts <- vst(ddsObj.raw, blind = TRUE)
plotPCA(vstcounts,  intgroup = c("Status", "TimePoint"))
```

In this case we can, from both the PCA and our understanding of the biology, be
fairly certain that the interaction model is the appropriate model to use.

## Exercise 6

```{r interactionModel, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, include = FALSE}
interaction.model <- as.formula(~ TimePoint * Status)
ddsObj.raw <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi = txi,
                                      colData = sampleinfo,
                                      design = interaction.model)
keep <- rowSums(counts(ddsObj.raw)) > 5
ddsObj.filt <- ddsObj.raw[keep,]

ddsObj.interaction <- DESeq(ddsObj.filt)
```

# 9. Extracting specific contrasts from an interaction model

With an interaction model we can no longer ask the general question "What is the
difference in gene expression between Infected and Uninfected?", but must rather
ask two more specific questions:

* "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected at 11 days post infection?"   
* "What is the difference in gene expression between Infected and 
Uninfected at 33 days post infection?"    

If we view the `resultsNames` for the interaction model, we can see the intercept
is Uninfected and 11 days post infection:

```{r resNamInteraction}
resultsNames(ddsObj.interaction)
```

The main effect `Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected` is therefore the difference
between Infected and Uninfected **at 11 days post infection**. 

```{r, resIntd11}
results.interaction.11 <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
                                  name = "Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected",
                                  alpha = 0.05)
```

To get the results for Infected versus Uninfected at 33 days post infection, 
we would need to add the interaction term `TimePointd33.StatusInfected`.

In the help page for `results` it shows us how to do this with a `contrast` in 
example 3.

```{r resIntd33}
results.interaction.33 <- results(ddsObj.interaction, 
                                  contrast = list(c("Status_Infected_vs_Uninfected",
                                                    "TimePointd33.StatusInfected")),
                                  alpha = 0.05)
```

Number of genes with padj < 0.05 for Test v Control at day 11:

```{r nSigIntd11}
sum(results.interaction.11$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

Number of genes with padj < 0.05 for Test v Control at day 33:

```{r nSigIntd33}
sum(results.interaction.33$padj < 0.05, na.rm = TRUE)
```

We can see that there is a strong difference in the effects of infection on 
gene expression between days 11 and 33.

## Exercise 7

# 10. Save the results

Finally save the corrected sample metadata, the DESeq2 dataset, and the two 
DESeq2 results objects.

```{r saveObjects, eval = FALSE}
write_tsv(sampleinfo, "results/samplesheet_corrected.tsv")
saveRDS(ddsObj.interaction, "results/DESeqDataSet.interaction.rds")
saveRDS(results.interaction.11, "results/DESeqResults.interaction_d11.rds")
saveRDS(results.interaction.33, "results/DESeqResults.interaction_d33.rds")
```
